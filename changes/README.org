* Introduction

  This directory contains descriptions of changes that were made to
  TeX sources of the final draft of the Common Lisp specification as
  well as the X3J13 cleanup issues to produce the contents of the
  file:../dpANS3 and file:../issues directories respectively.

* Change Description Format

  Each change description is contained in a single file. Each file
  contains a single s-expression of the following form:

  #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
    (:change
     ()
     :kind        (:KIND₁ :KIND₂ …)
     :description "DESCRIPTION"
     :who         "NAME <EMAIL>"
     :when        "UNIVERSAL-TIME")
  #+END_SRC

  A change will usually specify a single kind but multiple kinds may
  be needed in rare cases. The currently defined kinds are:

  + ~:encoding~ :: The encoding of a file was changed.

  + ~:syntax~ :: A file was changed to fix a syntax error. This mostly
                 applies to cleanup issues since there is a defined
                 syntax but conformance to this syntax was apparently
                 not enforced.

  + ~:markup~ :: The markup in a file was changed in a way that would
                 not affect the representation in the CLHS. An example
                 of this kind of change is correcting a ~\funref~
                 reference to a ~\macref~ reference since both would
                 result in the same hyperlink in the CLHS.

  + ~:reference~ :: A reference was changed either from a non-existing
                    target to an existing target or from an incorrect
                    target to a correct target. These changes would be
                    reflected in the CLHS representation. An example
                    of this kind of change is correcting the reference
                    ~\macref{destruct}~ to ~\macref{defstruct}~.

  + ~:semantic~ :: A change that affects the semantic of the
                   specification. An example is changing the ftype of
                   the ~slot-value~ component from ~Function~ to
                   ~Accessor~ and extending the syntax part to include
                   the ~setf~ syntax.

  + ~:listing~ :: A change that fixes the validity of the contents of
                  a listing as Common Lisp code.

  The following kinds can be used as a an additional element of the
  list of kinds but can not be used as the only element of the list:

  + ~:tex-macro~ :: The change affects a TeX macro.

  + ~:typo~ :: The change corrects a problem that is assumed to be the
               result of typo.

* Versioning Policy and Retrieving Diffs

  A change description is always committed together with the
  corresponding changes to the draft specification and issue
  sources. Change descriptions may be changed in later
  commits. Changes to the draft specification and issue sources may
  not be amended. That is, further changes require new change
  descriptions.

  Given a change description ~changes/NAME.sexp~, the corresponding
  changes to the draft specification and issue sources can be obtained
  using the following method:

  1. Determine the git commit $c$ that created the file
     ~changes/NAME.sexp~

  2. For the commit $c$ produce the diff restricted to the directories
     ~dpANS3~ and ~issues~.

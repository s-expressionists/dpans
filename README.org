* Introduction

  This repository contains the TeX and plain-text source files from
  which the Common Lisp ANSI standard and the Common Lisp HyperSpec
  were created.

  The only changes to the source files correct typographic, syntactic
  and other minor errors and should be easily identifiable from the
  version history of the repository and/or the file:changes directory.

* Purpose

  The purpose of this repository is making slightly fixed versions of
  the mentioned documents easily accessible for further processing.

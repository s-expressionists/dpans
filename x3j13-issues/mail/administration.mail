In all of the 15 years you speakof, the FOR/LOOP stuff has mostly been confined to Interlisp and to theprogeny of the MIT Lisp Machine.  Therefore, only a fraction of theCommon Lisp community has had day-to-day access to this facility.  Ifthe people who had used this facility were unanimous in singing itspraises, that might be sufficient experience, but they are not.It seems that we are divided along a couple of axes:Some people like the bag-of-tricks approach that LOOP provides, somepeople think DO is sufficient, and some people want something based on amore unified (if less flexible) theory, such as LetS.For a package of LOOP-like things, some people like the cutepseudo-English syntax, and some hate this, preferring that phrases(operators and their arguments) be glued together with parenthesesrather than "from", "to", "whereas", and their friends.We always get about this far and then bog down in irreconcilablereligious differences.  It seems to me that the right approach forpeople who want to push some package that goes beyond DO is to designsomething that they really like, put out a public-domain portableversion, and encourage people to try it.  A year later, if all goeswell, they should be in a position to say "look, we're all using this,let's standardize it".  That assumes that the people who think theydon't like package X are willing to try it, and that once they try itthey realize that they like it after all.  If we remain divided, I thinkthat having several competing solutions available in portable form is alivable solution, though obviously not optimal.-- Scott*start*04277 00024 USaReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 17 DEC 86 20:10:39 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Wed 17 Dec 86 23:02:08-ESTDate: Wed, 17 Dec 86 23:02 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12263664667.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

The mailing addresses aboveare from Gabriel's X3J13 file, so presumably they all work.  We'll see.For now, we can probably just stick these names on each messageinstead of setting up a re-mailing system.I've included RPG and Mathis on the theory that someone ought to monitorall the committee mail, just to make sure that the groups neitheroverlap nor develop serious gaps between them.  I don't know who wantsto do this, but until it is decided, I thought it best to put theproto-officer-nominees in that position.I've contacted Dave Moon to see if he wants to participate in thiscommittee.  He was very active before and I think he would be a veryvaluable addition if he wants to spend the time.  I gather that he wouldhave been at Dallas, but for some last-minute problems.  If there aresome other people who were not at Dallas, but who might be valuableadditions to this list, please suggest them.  Let's not inflate it toomuch, however, until we develop a feeling for what procedures areworkable.My own view is that we want to set up a sort of tree structure to handlethis.  We should elect someone chairman of this committee, and it wouldbe his job to coordinate and prod things along.  He should probably alsokeep the lists of issues to be resolved, proposals that are beingconsidered, and things we've settled.  The other committee members wouldeach take responsibility for formulating proposals on some set ofissues, and we would all review the proposals as they come in.  Each ofus can involve whatever friends and assistants we might have to getour proposals worked out, debugged, and described coherently.  So we'vegot a sort of tree structure from the chairman to all of us to whoeverwe recruit.Once we've got proposals we like (or a coherent set of alternatives), Isuppose we should run these past the Common Lisp mailing list.  Isuggest that we put out a big batch of proposals at once, harvest anygood ideas or useful criticisms, go back into committee, and makemodifications there.  We should probably not answer every comment, getinto debates on the Common Lisp mailing list, or encourage others outthere to debate among themselves.  We'll have to move very cautiously toavoid a repeat of last summer's mail storm.Then we take the proposals (as modified) to X3J13, and at that point theformal checks and balances start.  Because these are so extensive, Ithink we can get away with something much less formal on the big mailinglist -- the view should be that we are drafting proposals, and that weare occasionally asking the big mailing list to help us in draftingthose proposals.It would be nice to have a batch of easy things ready for the Februarypre-notification deadline that precedes the next meeting, whenever thatis.  Having some concrete proposals next time would make everyone feelgood.  But it may be that all we'll have is a progress report -- weshouldn't press for quick results if it means going off half-cocked.Those are just my own suggestions -- please feel free to comment orcounter-propose.For myself, I would prefer not to be the chairman, so that I can spendmore time on the technical side of things.  I will spend some time inthe next couple of weeks to clean up and organize the materials andissues I gathered last summer, and I plan to work on a good share of theproposals, but I'd prefer not to be the coordinator on this.  Is anyoneout there willing to do this job?  If we get more than one candidate, wecould even have an election.-- Scott*start*02928 00024 US Return-Path: <Moon@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by Xerox.COM ; 22 DEC 86 20:32:22 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 29908; Mon 22-Dec-86 23:30:30 ESTDate: Mon, 22 Dec 86 23:29 ESTFrom: David A.

I don't think it makes sense to think of that as optional,or as a painful but necessary duty.  Those people out there can provide asanity check.  Also, if enough of them don't like something it won't fly,no matter what X3J13 says, unless the Lisp community has suddenly becomea lot more authoritarian than I think.I think a better idea for avoiding mail storms is to let proposals out oneat a time, or a few at a time, rather than in big batches.  I certainlyagree that there should be no obligation to answer every comment.  Lettingthe people out there debate among themselves is fine.  The X3J13 processshould slow things down enough that there is no problem in waiting forthe discussion on the big mailing list, if a discussion starts, to convergeor peter out before finalizing the proposal.    ...the view should be that we are drafting proposals, and that we    are occasionally asking the big mailing list to help us in drafting    those proposals.Agreed.*start*01743 00024 USaReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 05 JAN 87 08:06:27 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Mon 5 Jan 87 10:56:42-ESTDate: Mon, 5 Jan 87 10:56 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12268513342.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

We should lay out theserious alternatives and discuss the costs and benefits of each.  Ifimplementors have predominantly gone one way, that should be a factor.In the case of incompatible changes, that's where a careful cost/benefitanalysis following the charter's guidelines is called for.  Most of yourproposed criteria apply here.In the case of proposed additions, that's where codifying andstandardizing existing practice comes in, along with some considerationof costs to the implementors and a general bias toward not making thelanguage grow too big without good reason.Of course, there will be soem borderline cases.Almost as important as deciding what to do in specific cases is thequestion of what order to discuss things in.  That's where the chairmanhas a lot of input.  My only suggestions are to knock off a lot oflittle self-contained things first and to delay optional extensions(e.g. adding FUNCTION-PARAMETERS or whatever we ended up calling it)until later.  We don't want to get bogged down discussing extensions.-- Scott*start*01730 00024 USaReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 08 JAN 87 19:12:24 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Thu 8 Jan 87 22:12:10-ESTDate: Thu, 8 Jan 87 22:12 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12269422752.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

What I had in mind wasneglecting to say anything about what happens when you divide by zero orwhen several let-variable are named by the same symbol.To me, the difference between a change and an addition or extension isthat the latter can be implemented portably.  Of course, for very largeextensions, such as the object system, you get cases that are "nearlyportable": they require only a few small changes in the language and alot of compatible additions.There have been some calls for removal of not-terribly-useful featuresfrom the language, just to make Common Lisp smaller, but I don't thinkthat many of us take these proposals seriously.  To remove things nowwould just have the effect of breaking working code for no good reason.I distinguish this from proposals (some of which I favor) for removingthings that are currently ill-defined or that continue to cause troublefar beyond their worth.  In my view, for example, we would bewell-advised to flush macrolet, since it would get rid of a dozenproblems that we don't know how to fix otherwise.  All such proposalsare incompatible changes, of course.-- Scott*start*02003 00024 US Return-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 08 JAN 87 21:43:36 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Fri 9 Jan 87 00:39:52-ESTDate: Fri, 9 Jan 87 00:39 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12269449630.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

It is important torun all of our proposals by the larger community before anythign is castin concrete, as a sort of sanity check and in order to prevent theperception that a closed cabal is at work.

We formulate, discuss, and initially debug proposals just amongourselves.2. Once we've got a batch of proposals in what we think is good shape,we send them to Common Lisp for comment.  We should listen for goodideas and useful suggestions from "out there", but we should not feelthat we have to answer every comment that goes by.  We should, ofcourse, pay special attention to any comments of the form "this willscrew my company/implementaiton for the following reason..."3. After a decent interval, we ask ourselves (on the cleanup mailinglist) whether we heard anything that makes us want to modify theproposals.  If such modifications are extensive, we may decide to sendthe new proposal back to the big list for further comment.4. Once proposals have passed through the above process, we send them toX3J13 in batches.  We should bear in mind that there is a whole formalset of checks and balances that starts at this time -- steps 1 - 3should be viewed as merely a way of producing well-debugged proposals asinput to the formal decision process.-- Scott*start*01369 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:masinter.pa@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 10 JAN 87 16:34:41 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 10 Jan 87  16:33:35 PSTReceived: from Chardonnay.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 10 JAN 87 15:28:25 PSTFrom: masinter.paDate: 10 Jan 87 15:26:00 PSTSubject: Re: Discussion strategyIn-reply-to: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU's message of Sat, 10 Jan 87 15:46 EST, <FAHLMAN.12269876769.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>To: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUcc: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <870110-152825-3903@Xerox>I agree with your suggestion in the main.For those proposals that were already discussed (in some cases adnaseum) on the Common-Lisp@su-ai mailing list, I'm reluctant to re-openthe discussion.I think it is important for the credibility of this committee that weget something, no matter how small, into the official pipeline, just todemonstrate that X3j13 actually can adopt some change to Common Lisp andhave it stick.

Fahlman" <Fahlman@C.CS.CMU.EDU>To: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUSubject: Format of proposalsBefore I comment on Larry's first three proposals, I have a couple ofminor points on the format.First, I think it would be a good idea to very cleanly separate theproposal itself from all the rationale.  It is the proposal that we arevoting on and asking X3J13 to adopt.  The rationale is important infocusing the subsequent discussion, but it fundamentally different fromthe proposal itself.  It is not the sort of thing where we have to getevery word right and then chisel the result into stone forever.  I'd goso far as to put the proposal itself first, then some sort of very clearbarrier (line of *'s or whatever), then all the rationale.Second, I'm wondering what Larry intends by the message numbers heincludes in the message headers.  If I respond to his first proposal,should I say "Re: Issue: GET-SETF-METHOD-ENVIRONMENT, Message 2" ?  Thatwon't work -- I'll forget to do it, and things will get screwed up ifseveral of us send messages that cross in the mail.I'd suggest that each revision to a specific proposal be given a number,so that we can refer to "GET-SETF-METHOD-ENVIRONMENT, version 3245" orwhatever, but if we want to refer to messages themselves, something like"Moon's mail of 1/11/86, 23:30" should do the job.-- Scott*start*00959 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:masinter.PA@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 11 JAN 87 21:21:12 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 11 Jan 87  21:19:44 PSTReceived: from Chardonnay.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 11 JAN 87 20:34:31 PSTFrom: masinter.PADate: 11 Jan 87 20:32:04 PSTSubject: Re: Format of proposalsIn-reply-to: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU's message of Sun, 11 Jan 87 22:04 EST, <FAHLMAN.12270207847.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>To: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUcc: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <870111-203431-4227@Xerox>I'm not sure my intentions in labelling the messages as Number 1 werewell thought out.

Fahlman" <Fahlman@C.CS.CMU.EDU>    Second, I'm wondering what Larry intends by the message numbers he    includes in the message headers....    I'd suggest that each revision to a specific proposal be given a number,    so that we can refer to "GET-SETF-METHOD-ENVIRONMENT, version 3245" or    whatever, but if we want to refer to messages themselves, something like    "Moon's mail of 1/11/86, 23:30" should do the job.I agree that numbering the messages themselves doesn't make sense.  Ibelieve the issues should be numbered; this makes tracking multipleongoing conversations considerably easier.  I'm not happy with the ideathat Larry apparently sent out three different issues to start with, allnumbered 1.  I think they should have been 1, 2, and 3.  Or maybe 20,21, and 22, to avoid clashing with the numbers from last spring.  (Forsome reason those messages never got to me, only Scott's replies sayinghe agreed with them.  Where were they sent?)Let me restate this a different way.  I think numbers should be assignedto each issue, uniquely identifying that issue.  I don't think the uniqueidentifier should be a combination of some descriptive text and a versionnumber; descriptive text tends to be gradually mutated as the conversationprogresses, something like playing "telephone".  As for version numbers, ifan issue (or a proposal for an issue) is revised so drastically that previousdiscussion is irrelevant and a new number should be assigned, then a newissue number should be assigned.  Maybe it's a good idea to relate it tothe previous version number, e.g. if initially it was issue 69, then thefirst revision is issue 69.1.*start*01091 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 14 JAN 87 06:33:39 PSTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 14 Jan 87  06:30:54 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Wed 14 Jan 87 09:30:59-ESTDate: Wed, 14 Jan 87 09:30 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12270857044.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

I personally don't mindkeeping all my CL-Cleanup mail in a single linear file, as long asthings can be located easily by searching for the name of the issue.Only the proposals themselves and the rationale that we plan to presentto X3J13 need to kept in some official, accessible place.By the way, I agree with Moon that we would be better off using numbersas the canonical identifiers for these issues, rather than names.  Wewould start with proposal 37.0, for example, and revised versions wouldbe numbered 37.1, 37.2, etc.)  The header line could say something like"Proposal 37.0: Doing away with CDR", but the search key is the 37, notsome awkard phrase.  That's just my preference, however -- if you reallywant to stay with the label system you've been using, I can live withit.One other suggestion: we really should try to keep all the technicaldiscussions on CL-Cleanup and not resort to private exchanges of mail.The use of back channels sometimes makes it possible to settle somepoint without bothering everyone else, but more often it just means thatthe others have to be brought up to date later.  This list is smallenough that we're not in danger of swamping one another with ourdiscussions.  (Of course, sensitive political issues like "Do you haveany idea why X is being such an asshole over this point?" should bediscussed within a more limited group.)-- Scott*start*02359 00024 USaReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 22 JAN 87 19:23:57 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Thu 22 Jan 87 22:23:11-ESTDate: Thu, 22 Jan 87 22:23 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12273094756.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

I'd like to get some of these issues sorted out,    and the back mail summarized on some of the open issues. Can you/they    help?I added Rob Maclachlan and Dave McDonald, mostly because they are bothvery good critics: Dave sees all the technical implications of thingsfor stock hardware (he has been principal architect of our Lisp for theRT and was half of the team that originally did DEC's Vaxlisp); Robcatches of all sorts of problems that slip by me -- he resembles Moon inthat respect.  Dave isn't much of a proposal writer or organizer,however, and Rob is busy proposing things on the windows list and on thecompiler cleanup committee.If there are particular issues you want proposals on, I may be able toget some of my people to help out.  For the adjustablearray/displacement question you mentioned, I was hoping Steele wouldvolunteer, but if he doesn't I may be able to get one of my people toproduce a coherent proposal.  Unfortunately, we're not in a goodposition here to summarize old discussions, as our archives areincomplete and the Stanford archives are in a format that is utterlyworthless to us.  (Steele, on the other hand, has the whole thing set upfor instant access on the Connection Machine, but for some reason heonly likes to use that sparingly -- maybe he can't get at the machien inquestion very often.)On the issue of responding to Moon's comments: I will try to producecleaned-up proposals reflecting his specific criticisms.  On the generalissue of macros and environments, I think it would be worth wrestlingwith this a little more before we decide it is a hard case and should beput off until later.

If people get moving on thesethings, we might be able to have a bunch of well-debugged proposalsready to circulate at the meeting, so that people can see that SOMEprogress is being made.  These can be voted on later, by mail or at thefollowing meeting.Since only three of us seem to be participating in the mail discussions,I suppose a face-to-face meeting of the cleanup committee would beuseful if more than a few of us will be there.  If it's only the samethree people who are communicating by mail, then nothing is gained by ameeting.My own preference would be to meet just before the full X3J13 comitteemeets, rather than after.  There are two reasons for this: First, if wecaucus before the full meeting, it maximizes the chance that we'll havesome results to present at the larger meeting (or that we'll understandwhy the committee is making no progress and have some ideas about how tofix that).Second, my own plan was to fly west on the Saturday before the meetingin order to get a halfway reasonable plane fare by staying over oneSaturday night -- I have to check, but I don't think the discount onDelta does me any good at all, since Delta doesn't fly into Pittsburgh.The plan was to redeye back right after the meeting; the trip alreadyhas me away from home for five nights, and I'm very reluctant to extendit for another night.  So my preference would be to meet Monday morning,unless that screws up the travel plans for everyone else.  If we do ourhomework, a short meeting should accomplish everything that is going tobe accomplished.-- Scott*start*01446 00024 USaReturn-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:Masinter.pa@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 28 JAN 87 17:57:39 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 28 Jan 87  17:49:43 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 28 JAN 87 16:40:50 PSTDate: 28 Jan 87 16:40 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: face-to-face meeting at X3In-reply-to: David A.

Fahlman" <Fahlman@C.CS.CMU.EDU>To: Masinter.paCc: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUSubject: Format for cleanup proposalsLarry,I think that this document should just be a proposed format for cleanupproposals.  We should not include a "Report from the cleanup committee".We'll give a report at the meeting, explaining why things have gone soslowly and what we hope to do about that, but don't need to send thatout as an X3J13 document right now.The boilerplate form for proposals should not contain a sectiondescribing the votes of the cleanup committee.  I don't think that it isour job to vote on these things, at least not in the usual sense.  It isour job to formulate coherent, well-debugged proposals for considerationof X3J13, along with appropriate rationale and our recommendation incases where our committee clearly favors one path over another.  We mayspeak of "voting" on these things, but I see it as a process in which weare aksing whether anyone on the committee sees any problems, and whatour recommendation should be.  Where consensus cannot be reached in oursubcommittee, it should not be a majority-rules situation; rather, weshould send up a set of alternatives, with the arguments for each.The chairman (and probably the rest of us as well) will want to keeptrack of the positions committee members have taken on these issues, butI submit that the public "proposals" file is the wrong place to do this.I don't like the proposed classification of proposals intoClarification, Mistake, Omission, and Enhancement.  These are notdisjoint sets.  Most of the clarifications result from some omission orunderspecification in CLtL; only a few result from explicit ambiguities.Classifying something as a mistake would require that the proposersomehow has access to the intentions of the "authors".  I'm not sureeven the authors can remember their intentions reliably in all cases; Iknow first-hand that one of them has trouble.  You make no provision fordeliberate changes or for non-minor enhancements.  I think it isreasonable to say that we want to avoid those things if possible, but toadopt a format in which they cannot legitimately be proposed seems likea mistake (or maybe an omission...).I would go with Clarification, Change, and Enhancement.  It will usuallybe obvious from the proposal itself and the rationale whether the issueis major or minor and whether the proposal is conservative or radical.Asking the proposers to classify things along these axes doesn't seemworthwhile.I also dislike the separate identifiers for issues and proposals.These are going to get muddled together, and the person making aproposal will want to describe the issue in his own way.Finally, I think that the business of assigning canonical identifiersshould be kept as neutral as possible.  I would suggest that we allowthe person submitting a proposal to provide some descriptive label(not-canonical), and the chairman assigns only a number.  Yes, somenumbers will get wasted and issues will end up out of order, but anyonewhose checking account provides numbered checks should be used to thisby now.My revised format proposal is included, so that you can see how it wouldlook with these changes.-- Scott---------------------------------------------------------------------------Proposal label:< A short descriptive label provided by the person submitting theproposal.

I would suggest the    following -- just an idea to kick around, subject to change: Masinter,    Moon, and I remain on this cleanup committee. ... If any of you object    to being flushed and want to assume a more active role ...I dislike your use of the verb "flush" here. It has the very negativeconnotations that I think are out of order.I vote to have myself left on the list of active contributors.In fact, I vote to have everyone left on the list. This committee'scharter is not to vote on things, so issues of quorum are prettyirrelevant. Neither are issues of attribution. When all is said anddone, it will be obvious who has actively participated and who has not,so there is also no point in prejudging this issue of who is "active"and who is "passive".People who are on the list should not be encouraged to say anythingunless they have something to say. Let's try not to create a climate inwhich people think that verbosity is synonymous with participation.Most of the mail which has crossed the list thus far has beenof two kinds: administrative and simple proposals.I don't much care what format the proposals are in. I happen to not be ecstatic about the format you guys are suggesting, but I don't dislike them enough to make noise about it since I expect that furtherdiscussion of any kind would just slow progress to no good end.In truth, I feel obliged to read and carefully consider everything anyone sends, and will do so regardless of the format. My mail readeruses In-Reply-To and References fields, not subject lines, to trackwhat relates to what and it's easy enough to manually patch the fewmessages that come in without those fields. That's enough for me.As for the proposals that have crossed the list before this week,the main reason that I've said nothing is that I've had nothingparticularly useful to say on them. I could send out messages likeScott's that said "I read over this and it looks ok." but as someonepointed out, this isn't really a forum for voting so it doesn't matter.When time comes for voting, I'll be sure to participate. I thinkthe issues raised thus far have received adequate coverage eitherby the individual who wrote the proposal or those who have chosen toreply (mostly Moon, I guess). In any case, I saw no point in remarkingfurther.I've been over this week's proposal from Rob about evaluation/compilationand do have some comments on that which will follow later when I havetime to write them up.Several times I've been on the verge of sending proposals of my own onlyto find new mail in my mailbox on that day saying that the format ofproposals had changed once again. I hope we can agree that while thereis a desirable format, it's not important enough to hold up useful work.I was dismayed that DLA (after all his careful work writing things upto spec) was asked to represent his proposal in another format. This kind of pickiness is likely to bog us down and be the real cause ofany failure on our part to produce. Rob's proposal is also not in the"proper format" (if I correctly understand the current theory after allthe changes that keep getting made). I hope no one will ask him to wastehis time "fixing it" and that we can just work with what we've got.By the way, on an unrelated note, I've just finalized my plane reservations for California and will definitely be around for theweekend before the meeting. I can be free Sunday afternoon ifsomeone wanted to go through with the idea of a face-to-face meetingabout any of this. I think a very reasonable thing that could beaccomplished at such a meeting would be to divide up Steele's list of things that need addressing so that we didn't have to wonder who was going to take responsibility for what.*start*05467 00024 US Return-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 22 FEB 87 18:55:22 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Sun 22 Feb 87 21:55:03-ESTDate: Sun, 22 Feb 87 21:55 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12281216114.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

Idon't really disagree with Larry's description, but I would shift theemphasis a bit.It seems to me that what this subcommittee needs to do is to put forth acoherent, well debugged set of proposals that we think should beadopted.  Certainly we should also pass along alternative proposals, andif we deadlock on some issue we should just pass along both optionsalong with the argument for each.  It is not our place to make any finaldecisions, but I think there has to be some leadership on thesetechnical issues, and I think that has to come from us.  If we justcollect a laundry list of random proposals and pass them along, all weare doing is shifting the problem of technical analysis to a body tooponderous to handle it.I also feel that, while we should leave the spec-writing to others, ourcommittee cannot completely avoid questions of terminology.  Some of theambiguities we are dealing with and some of the messes we must clean upare best fixed by clearly sorting out the relevant concepts and hanginga good label on each.  And some of these terms will poke through intoCommon Lisp itself.  For example, if we adopt the view that "specialform" refers to the whole list and "special operator" refers to thesymbol that is the car of that list, then we want to renameSPECIAL-FORM-P to SPECIAL-OPERATOR-P.  We shouldn't get into thebusiness of writing sections of the manual, but I think we're as good agroup as any to define what various technical terms are supposed torefer to.We've got a much more serious problem, and I think that it is essentialthat we develop a plan for handling it before we all get to Palo Alto.This committee is not making much progress for the simple reason that wedon't have a critical mass of active people on this committe.  We don'thave enough people to produce the proposals, and we never hear from mostof the committee members when a proposal is put forward.As I understand it, Jonl has withdrawn.  RPG mentioned that some otherLucid person, perhaps Eric Benson might join, but this hasn't happenedyet.KMP has been totally incommunicado, and Dave Matthews nearly so;I'm not sure whether this is because of mail system lossage or lack oftime, but the effect is the same in any case.It seemed at the Dallas meeting that Guy was joining this group ratherreluctantly, and he has been awfully quiet, though he did answer my "areyou there?" message with the axolotls in it.Dave Moon stated when he joined up that most of his Common Lisp timewould have to go into the object committee rather than cleanup.  Theplan was that, for now at least, he would react to proposal but not tryto produce any.  He has done that.Larry is putting some effort into orgnization and administration.  Ihave put some effort into cleaning up the initial list of proposals.  Ithink that both of us are willing to shoulder a share of the load, butnot half of it.I would suggest the following -- just an idea to kick around, subject tochange:Masinter, Moon, and I remain on this cleanup committee.  Guy, as asoon-to-be officer of X3J13, moves to ex-officio-observer status, thatsame as RPG and Mathis.  The other members are removed from the cleanupcommittee, though they are welcome to remain on the mailing list if theywant to observe what goes on and comment occasionally.(If any of you object to being flushed and want to assume a more activerole in all this, and if your local mail system agrees, that would begreat.  Just say so.)Then we try to get four new people on this committee who will dig in anddo something.  The best way to do this is probably to invite specificpeople, rather than asking for volunteers from among the X3J13membership -- that would be a pretty sure way to get another load ofdead wood.  I can think of a few people who might be good in this role:Rob Maclachlan, Eric Benson, and Skef Wholey.  I'm sure that you canthink of others.If we get some of these people to sign up, we can announce that fact atthe next meeting.  If other X3J13 people want to join, we let them; ifthey don't contribute, we flush them later.  That way we avoid anyaccusation of excluding people or companies.  Balance is not tooimportant on this committee, since it does not have ultimatedecision-making power, but I think it's better to include a couple oflosers than to make a couple of enemies.We may want to consider collapsing the compiler and cleanup committeesinto one, flushing the inactive members from both.Comments?  Other suggestions?  Axolotls?-- Scott*start*01840 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 23 FEB 87 13:25:24 PSTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 23 Feb 87  13:23:15 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Mon 23 Feb 87 16:23:56-ESTDate: Mon, 23 Feb 87 16:23 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12281417979.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

I think we may have had a funny deadlock situation here.  Isuspect that one of the reasons there has been so much emphasis onformats has been that we didn't feel we could make progress on anythingmore substantive because only a couple of us seemed to be in the loop.And now it appears that this administrative stuff has inhibited peoplefrom joining in.  Maybe soon we can get past this and get rolling.I continue to feel that most (not all!) of these cleanup things arereally pretty easy: it doesn't matter too much which way they go, aslong as we get a decision one way or the other.  So quick progress onthe majority of these issues should be possible -- only a few of thempresent significant technical challenges.Dividing up the issues list among some number of people seems like agood way to start.  Doing this in person would be OK if enough of us areat the meeting; if that can't be arranged, then doing it by mail wouldwork better.  I guess the first step is to get an inventory of how many"actives" we have, and to decide whether we need to add some new ones.-- Scott*start*01530 00024 US Return-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 04 MAR 87 17:54:14 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Wed 4 Mar 87 20:54:08-ESTDate: Wed, 4 Mar 87 20:54 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12283826455.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

We have a lotto accomplish between now and the next meeting. We also all have othercommitments, and this will only work if we can maintain a fairly steadyflow of background work.I think for us to have a reasonable set of proposals for the fullcommittee to vote on next meeting we need everyone on this distributionlist to basically volunteer to write up approximately one issue perweek, with the understanding that some will take longer, and others willtake less time.I'm reluctant to arbitrarily assign issues to people, and would ratherthat you volunteer for the ones that you want to work on. However, I'mwilling to try to assign things randomly if you think it would help getthings rolling.Does anyone disagree with the scheduling? Have any alternative proposalsfor how we might proceed? If not, I'd like to hear from each and every one of you about what yourschedule might be in the next couple of months for truding through thecurrent issues, both the ones that we've discussed and the ones in theissues file.Please reply to the whole list.Thanks,Larry*start*01830 00024 USmReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 07 APR 87 09:20:27 PDTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Tue 7 Apr 87 11:47:22-EDTDate: Tue, 7 Apr 87 11:47 EDTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12292628888.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

Not having easy access to these things since the last meetinghas been just enough of an obstacle to get me to do somethign elseinstead.  Where are these proposals currently stored and how do I accessthem?  I would need to get at things in plain-ASCII format, not full ofhairy formatting stuff that only Xerox editors can understand.Once we've got the backlog under control, I could attack a handful ofsmall issues or a few larger ones.  Do you have a menu of issues notdealt with yet?I'd like to put together a proposal for &more.  It's not as urgent assome other things, but I'd like to get it on the table and see if itanyone else thinks it is a good idea.I can spend a bit of time each day reacting to things produced byothers, and something like a day a week producing new proposals.Obviously, if there's a flood of other proposals to study, I would haveless time to produce.  Some things I can pass off to other CMU people.I'll be totally unavailable (out of the country) April 21 - 29, and June23 - July 8.  This means that I will miss the Boston meeting,unfortunately -- I'm hoping the department will send Rob Maclachlan inmy place.-- Scott*start*03786 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:Masinter.pa@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 07 APR 87 15:09:20 PDTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 7 Apr 87  15:06:14 PDTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 07 APR 87 14:53:31 PDTDate: 7 Apr 87 14:54 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: time to reactivate cl-cleanupIn-reply-to: "Scott E.

Looking overmy records, it seems I have your summary/current-status messages for thefirst seven issues on your list: Adjust-Array-Displacement throughFlet-Implicit-Block.  Did you send out the others?  If so, please sendme new copies -- I somehow seem to have lost them in my mail-shuffling.Let me volunteer to take a crack at five of those seven issues for whichI have the material.  Defvar-Initialization seems to be in final form,and I don't feel good about doing Compiler-Warning-Break, since it isKMP's baby and I think I'm mildly opposed to it.  I'll tryFlet-Implicit-Block, Environment-Arguments, Do-Symbols-Duplicates,Adjust-Array-Displacement (may delegate this one internally), andCompiler-Warning-Stream.  A couple of those are trivial; a couple arefairly hairy.If I get the materials in time, and if RPG doesn't indicate that he'sworking on it, I'll take a crack at Function-Type; then RPG can make afinal pass over what I've done.  Also, I want to produce a new proposalon &more, just so it will be on the table.  (May or may not be able toget to that one before my trip.)-- Scott*start*01218 00024 USaReturn-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 17 APR 87 11:46:16 PDTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Fri 17 Apr 87 14:45:56-EDTDate: Fri, 17 Apr 87 14:45 EDTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12295282839.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

You've seen all this flamage about bignum limit.  Ithink that Common Lisp is even worse than it used to be as a medium forrational discussion among informed people, so my inclination is to useit only as a final sanity check: announce what we propose to do, andthen listen quietly for any really coherent objections, without tryingto answer the lunatics.

Please cite a page reference that suggests they are allowed   to differ. I could not find a definition of the FUNCTION type specifier   when I looked just now.''The suggestion is on the same pages that allows the following two todiffer:	(let ((x '(or to-be (not to-be))))         (assert `(is-a question ,x)))	``To be or not to be: That is the question.''KMP's third sentence is the answer: FUNCTION is a type name symbolthat corresponds to no type, and therefore (typep x 'function) isnot defined. This is what this proposal attempts to remedy.However, to be slightly more serious, I am disturbed to always readthat Common Lisp must do this, that, or the other thing because otherwisethe effort to keep Macsyma up to date will suffer, or that the reason thatsome feature must continue to exist is because it is reflected in Macsyma usage. I like Macsyma as well as the next guy, but not enough tokill a language to keep its code legal.			-rpg-*start*01382 00024 USaReturn-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:Moon@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 13 MAY 87 16:26:44 PDTReceived: from SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 13 May 87  16:25:49 PDTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 139430; Wed 13-May-87 19:24:13 EDTDate: Wed, 13 May 87 19:24 EDTFrom: David A.

Maria Santosis making the arrangements.  Their phone number is (617)492-2071. They are reserving some rooms at the Cambridge Marriottat a rate of $115 (plus tax) per night (insead of the more usual$135). There will be some fee for refreshments and maybe a lunch.I don't know what it will be, but at the last two meetings wepaid $25 or $50. The meeting will be on Tuesday June 30 andWednesday July 1. We will be meeting from about 9am to 5pm eachday. There may be some subcommittee meetings on Monday. They arehoping to arrange some meeting rooms at MIT, but I don't know thespecifics yet. Hope you can all make it.I was thinking about the following agenda:   Tuesday morning     -- clean-up committee   Tuesday afternoon   -- X windows presentation, Japanese       characters presentation, administrative work of committee,       reports from various subcommittees and liaisons   Wednesday morning   -- continuation of subcommittee reports       and other business, clean-up committee   Wednesday afternoon -- clean-up committeeWe picked Tuesday and Wednesday for the main meeting so we coulduse Monday for subcommittees if needed.The X windows presentation will be by Robert Scheifler. We arenot looking at this for incorporation into the Common Lispstandard, but as an important and relevant related application.CLX is a proposed interface to the X Version 11 Window SystemProtocol. It is intended as fairly low-level veneer, to hidemundane details such as data encodings, network I/O, and even theexistance of an explicit inter-process communication channel. The intent is to provide direct access to features of theprotocol, but with an effective Lisp orientation, and withconsideration given to convenience of use. A goal was to permitefficient implementations on both conventional and Lisp-specificarchitectures, and to provide reasonable semantics in bothsingle-process and multi-process environments.  The expectationand desire is that this X-specific interface will be wrapped bymore generic and higher-level windowing and graphics interfaces,suitable for general application programming.  However, we didnot wish to preclude an X-specific, object-oriented system builtdirectly on this interface.

I'll be doing that tomorrow, probably.As I mentioned to people at the Palo Alto meeting, I won't be able to beat the Boston meeting -- I'll be in England on the dates in question.So I'll try to state positions on all the issues before I disappear, andthen trust you guys to do the right thing.  In particular, I don't thinkwe're very far apart on Moon's version of Proclaim-Lexical; there's adumb default case that he wants to leave "is an error" and I want tospecify, but I'm willing to yield on this if others think Moon is on theright track.I thought that I'd send Rob Maclachlan in my place, but he isn't eagerto make this trip, and given that there's been absolutely zero progresson the Compiler committee (thanks to Steve Haflich's inspiredleadership), the main reason for Rob's being there is gone.  I plan tosuggest to Mathis that the compiler committee be dissolved and that thisstuff be merged into "cleanup", perhaps along with some of the peoplefrom that committee.-- Scott*start*00905 00024 US Date:  1 Jun 87 09:33 PDTFrom: Masinter.pato: masinterfor fileSubject: Re: ballots, meeting, etc.In-reply-to: "Scott E.

Perhaps a physical meeting would let them get started.  The cleanup committee is currently scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday morning. If we set aside 1 hour for Rob to give a presentation about the compiler issues (what are the problems? Why does something need to be specified? What kind of options might be considered? ) i.e., without necessarily giving any kind of proposal, do you think he could do it? I'd rather see if we could move the compiler committee into action than try to take on the whole issue ourselves. *start*00590 00024 US Date:  1 Jun 87 09:38 PDTFrom: Masinter.paTO: MASINTERfor fileSubject: Re:  ballots, meeting, etc.In-reply-to: Dave Matthews <dcm%hpfclp@hplabs.HP.COM>'s message of Sun, 31 May 87 22:16:12 mdtTo: dcm%hpfclp@hplabs.HP.COMIf you intend to take the time to read and consider each issue at some point, it would help if you could do it sooner rather than later.   Are you withdrawing from the cleanup committee?

One is that no progress can possibly bemade while Haflich is running that committee.  He has flatly refused tothink about the comprehensive plans submitted by Rob and others,preferring instead to handle little issues one by one, and then hedoesn't do anything to get discussions started along the lines heprefers.  For the compiler, a comprehensive solution is essential in anyevent.So Haflich has to be deposed.  Rob hasn't been around X3J13 enough tohave nay clout of that kind.  I'm hoping that Mathis will ask thecompiler committee for a report and, when there is nothing at all tosay, will open discussions on how to reconstitute that committee.The other problem is that the kind of expertise required for thecompiler stuff is all concentrated on the cleanup committee.  Rob and Iare sort of interchangeable in this area, but we'll need input fromSteele, Moon, Gabriel, you, and maybe some of the others before anythigncan be accepted.  They don't have that kind of experience and diversityint he other group.  So it seems the simplest course to merge.-- Scott*start*02926 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:edsel!kent-state!eb@navajo.stanford.edu>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 01

Fahlman" <Fahlman@C.CS.CMU.EDU>To: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUSubject: General strategyBefore I start voting and commenting on specific issues, I'd like toraise a point about our general strategy.On important issues, where there is real disagreement within the cleanupcommittee or where the issue is so critical that all sides must becarefully explained, it is important that we present the issue withmultiple proposals and that the choosing is done by X3J13 as a whole.On the other hand, a lot of these issues are trivial little things thatneed to be cleaned up one way or another.  I believe that X3J13 and theCommon Lisp community as a whole want these to be resolved without a lotof needless agonizing, and they want this committee to provide theleadership to get that job done.  If there are two or three solutions tosome issue that differ only in "aesthetics", we on the cleanup committeeshould converge on one solution, propose it, and endorse it.We shouldn't say, "Well, we could do A and then again we could B, butsomeone suggeted C and that's OK too."  Instead, we should say, "Wepropose A."  In the discussion section we should say, "Solutions B and Cwere discussed, but the cleanup committee has settled on A as the bestsolution."  If we send multiple-choice proposals to X3J13 on trivialissues where it doesn't matter, the discussion will focus on thosestupid things and much more important issues will be neglected.A number of the proposals currently offer useless options of this kind,either as actual choices to be voted on or as variations suggested inthe discussion section.  We should try to resolve these among ourselvesrather than leaving them hanging.  I'm not worried about peoplefollowing us blindly -- X3J13 seems to have enough sharp and contentiouspeople on it to prevent any abuse of this power.-- Scott*start*03569 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 03 JUN 87 21:25:49 PDTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 3 Jun 87  21:24:27 PDTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Thu 4 Jun 87 00:23:54-EDTDate: Thu, 4 Jun 87 00:23 EDTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12307708833.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

The Error Committee is responsible for preparing a completeproposal. The Cleanup is responsible for making minor patches. This is aminor patch which is contingent on the Error Committee -not- doing something.It would be inappropriate for the Error Committee to make conflictingrecommendations. It is not inappropriate for two groups with (as youyourself said) different goals to make conflicting recommendations.I completely agree that the committees should not be merged. Althoughthere is a gray area in all of this where X3J13 adopts various proposalsof other committees and it may be appropriate for the Cleanup committeeto then take over the job of minor corrections to what at that pointamounts to a normal part of the language. We can cross that bridge whenwe come to it, though; it's certainly no relation to what's going on atthis point in any of the subcommittees I know of.*start*04906 00024 US Return-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by Xerox.COM ; 05 JUN 87 21:12:19 PDTReceived: from RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 165549; Sat 6-Jun-87 00:12:11 EDTDate: Sat, 6 Jun 87 00:11 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Sigh -- More procedureTo: Masinter.PAcc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU, KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMMessage-ID: <870606001157.6.KMP@RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>I'm sorry for the length of this message. It treats an issue whichI thought we'd settled before when Fahlman edited a proposal andforgot to change its status back to internal, but in my view thatagreement has been violated again an I want to re-open the issue: My votes are significantly based on the wording of a proposal, not justtheir spirit. My guess from their behavior is that many of the others onthis list do likewise. To me, no other choice is possible because thissame rigor is the manner in which CLtL gets interpreted by users andwe accept the fact that every word and punctuation mark could potentiallymake a difference.Earlier this week, I allocated a long evening to carefully re-read allthe relevant mail leading up to the proposals upon which we were askedto vote. I allocated this time at your request, believing that this wasthe final vote and that extreme care was in order. Now you've changedthe proposal and marked some things ready for release and/or falselyclaimed that the cleanup committee endorses this proposal, which in factthe cleanup committee has not seen.When I worked on the student newspaper at MIT, we had a policy that wedidn't reply to letters to the editor; the reason was that the paperalways had the opportunity to get in the last word and this wasn't fairin a forum which was supposed to promote open discussion.  Likewise, wehave an informal rule that the moderator at X3J13 meetings should notfeel free to interject comments in between designating queued speakers-- since he obviously has an unfair opportunity to say more than isappropriate. I think it would be useful if we could agree that themoderator here should follow the same conventions as everyone else ineither not being able to change things at the last minute.I'm willing to be very liberal in my definition of "the last minute".  Iconsider that the line was drawn when you yourself said we were making afinal vote and that if people had been hesitating that this was the timethey should say something. I think it is inconsiderate for you to thenmake further changes that cause me to feel compelled to spend more timewhen I've already gone for broke on my budgeted time at your ownsuggestion. I feel that since you have the last contact with the documentsbetween now and when they are seen by X3J13, that you have a moral obligation to resist changing them in that interval or to explicitly admitthat another full round of voting is in order.I was very hesitant to send out my change to AREF-1D and FORMAT-OP-Cproposals at the last minute, but it seemed clear that the vote was notgoing to favor the existing versions so there seemed little harm in gettingan early start on the next voting cycle. In fact, even after making allthe desired changes, I carefully marked both of these to have been approvedonly on previous passes so that people's votes would not be misconstrued.This kind of care may seem silly, but I believe it to be important.I would not have been and will not be disturbed if neither AREF-1D norFORMAT-OP-C is presented to X3J13 due to our having had too little timeto review the most recent proposals internally and re-vote.I want it clear that I have expressed no opinion on: KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-NAME-PACKAGE (Version 4) FORMAT-OP-C (Version 4)If either of these documents is distributed to X3J13 prior to my havingexpressed an opinion that they are acceptable in their current form, Iwill be upset. [If it is possible for me to accept either or both in thecurrent form, I'll try to do so to minimize work for all, but I can'tguarantee that.]By the way, the top of your message about KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-NAME-PACKAGEsays:  ``I made the discussion less wishy-washy by saying we rejected disallowing    NIL.  I made some edits to fix typos various people pointed out. I fixed    the "grinding".''In fact, you changed more than just the "Discussion" field. You changedthe Proposal field. I'm sure you meant to use the term generically and notto specifically mislead me into looking only in the Discussion field tosee what you'd changed, but perhaps this illustrates why every word is soimportant to me. One little difference (eg, the difference between "discussion"and "Discussion") can really have a big effect.*start*02437 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:Masinter.pa@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 05 JUN 87 22:11:14 PDTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 5 Jun 87  22:09:10 PDTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 05 JUN 87 21:45:45 PDTDate: 5 Jun 87 21:45 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: Sigh -- More procedureIn-reply-to: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>'s message of Sat, 6 Jun 87 00:11 EDTTo: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <870605-214545-2882@Xerox>I'm sorry Kent. In my rush to get things out to X3J13 and to respond tothe rather massive number of minor typos and corrections and remarksthat I recieved, I've been a bit sloppy about recording which sectionsgot edited in response to which remarks. One problem is that, as you sayyourself, people had been hesitating to say anything about proposals nowopen up (at the last minute) with lots of comments on them; in manycases, they are relevant and useful comments, and the only reasonablething to do is to address the comments in the proposal. I will say that I don't (and didn't) intend to release documents toX3J13 without there being some opportunity for objections by thiscommittee. The "the cleanup committee endorses this ..." statements are of courseprovisional. However, if we want to say that we endorse something byconsensus then I need to write it in the proposal itself. If theproposal says "FOO and JOE like this proposal." and then we all agree,and I edit it to say "we all agree", then, by your own rules, I'd haveto send it out again for yet another ballot since the wording changed.)I think we have a little more flexibility about wording than wasavailable CLtL because the wording of these proposals are in factsubject to the interpretation of the committee that actually writes thestandards document. That is, we're specifying intent and not exactwording. I will be more careful identifying the changes to proposals, and my useof "Ready for release".

When problems are spotted, even late in theprocess, they have to be fixed, and then we need another round ofconsideration.  Things only become final if we manage to come up with aversion that nobody objects to, or if we explicitly agree to disagree.For those of us who insist upon having a say on the final form of everyissue, it is impossible to set an a priori limit on the time that willbe required.  We need some balance between the power of the chairman toram through a lot of unexamined changes at the last minute and the powerof any one member to block progress because he has some other commitments.However, I agree with KMP that Masinter is at fault in several areas.The most serious problem is that he has greatly increased the amount oftime the rest of us must spend in considering new versions by changingthings in gratuitous and unrecorded ways.  Larry also put a few of hisown ideas into the new versions without any prior discussion -- apractice he used to complain bitterly about when I was chairman.Finally, he has thrown everyone into a panic by making it look like amodified proposal might go out with a statement of support by people whostated support for the previous version and not necessarily the currentone.-- Scott*start*00737 00024 US Return-Path: <MATHIS@ADA20.ISI.EDU>Received: from ADA20.ISI.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 08 JUN 87 14:09:18 PDTDate: 8 Jun 87 14:08 PDTSender: MATHIS@ADA20.ISI.EDUSubject: Re: Report from working group on Common Lisp window standards?From: MATHIS@ADA20.ISI.EDUTo: Masinter.paTo: spar!schoen@DECWRL.DEC.COMMessage-ID: <[ADA20.ISI.EDU] 8-Jun-87 14:08:01.MATHIS>In-Reply-To: <870608-112651-4186@Xerox>Eric,To get on the X3J13 mailing lists you send physical stuff to me(postal address, phone number etc) and electronic request tox3j13-request@su-ai.stanford.edu.

This is the summary I came up with:This file is a list of things that the CLOS committee would like to seecleaned up.  I have tried to keep it brief.  Where proposals have beensubmitted to the Cleanup committee, the proposal name is listed as"PROPOSAL: name".  Where the Cleanup committee has assigned an issuename, but there is no proposal yet, it is listed as "ISSUE: name".1. PROPOSAL: FUNCTION-TYPE   Making FUNCTION be a genuine type (distinct from CONS).2. PROPOSAL: KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-NAME-PACKAGE   Allowing keyword argument indicators to be non-keyword symbols.3. ISSUE: DEFSTRUCT-CLOS   A recommendation to design a DEFRECORD facility to replace the part   of DEFSTRUCT that is not replaced by DEFCLASS.4. ISSUE: PATHNAME-HASH-TABLE-TYPE-DISTINCT   Mandating a bunch of types (I don't have the complete list right now)   to be disjoint from a bunch of other types (again I don't have a   complete list right now) so that they can all be made into classes   without establishing any implementation-dependent subclass relationships.5. PROPOSAL: SHARP-COMMA-SPECIAL-FORM   (in some Cleanup documents this is called LOAD-TIME-EVAL)   A macro should be able to include in its expansion the same sort   of thing that the #, reader-macro produces, enabling load-time   evaluation.6. ISSUE: LEXICAL-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESSORS   Providing constructors and accessors for lexical environments.   This is somehow related to or a substitute for a symbol macro   facility [I don't understand the connection --Moon]7. (no issue name)   Implementation note: clarify that the value returned by SYMBOL-FUNCTION,   and the value accepted by SETF of SYMBOL-FUNCTION, are not necessarily   what the implementation actually stores for purposes of function calling.   Specifically, (SETF (SYMBOL-FUNCTION x) gf), where gf is a generic function,   might create compiled code for method dispatching and store it in a place   associated with x, so that a call to x will compile as a call to that   compiled code, and will never touch the generic function object.  However,   even if an implementation uses this technique, (SYMBOL-FUNCTION x) must   return the value gf, not the internal compiled code.  Furthermore,   (FUNCALL gf ...) must produce the correct effect; it is permissible for   it to be slower than calling the internal compiled code.8. (no issue name)   Require (deftype quote (object) `(member ,object)) to be built-in.9. (no issue name)   Class objects must be acceptable to TYPEP and SUBTYPEP as type-specifiers.   This is probably part of CLOS rather than anything for the Cleanup committee.*start*01185 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:Masinter.pa@Xerox.COM>Received: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 09 JUN 87 23:49:43 PDTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 9 Jun 87  23:49:17 PDTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 09 JUN 87 23:48:32 PDTDate: 9 Jun 87 23:48 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: object / cleanup subcommittee interactionIn-reply-to: David A.

The committee has been "meeting" via electronic mail. Foreach proposal, there has been an average of 10-15 messages. In most cases, the cleanup committee has explicitly endorsed theproposal -- i.e., we all think it is a good idea. In some cases, whilethe committee has generally agreed that the proposal is a good idea,there hasn't been sufficient time to obtain agreement about the exactform of the proposal; in those cases, while an earlier version wascirculated among the cleanup committee. In most of these proposals, someearlier version was circulated to the committee and explicitly voted on.In a few cases (identified in the proposal) there has been a great dealof disagreement, but that we generally thought that we should bring thematter to the attention of the larger group, for discussion andguidance. For your information, I have listed below all of the issues currentlyunder consideration, with an extremely brief description of the issue.If anyone is interested in further details, or in joining the cleanupcommittee, please let us know (CL-CLEANUP@Sail.stanford.EDU).

I passed it through completely unedited; in fact, I didn't have timeto read it while I was typing. I'll comment later when I've had time.There was also a cover letter that said:    ... I still have not been able to do much of anything with my account.    I tried to send mail but kept getting "no such local user" messages,    even when just directly responding to a test message from a non-local    friend. Nor have i received any X3-J13 mail at all yet. So if you want    to respond to this, I would appreciate your trying my netmail address,    but if your mail gets returned, please use [P.O. Box 747, Santa Barbara,    CA 93102; (805) 963-3412].    Regarding the order of arguments' evaluation, as in the     push-evaluation-order proposal, I still believe that this is specified in    CLtL. I mentioned the reference on page 97 to "the usual left-to-right     order in which the various subforms are evaluated" but have since found    a less oblique one: the entire last half of page 99.    It is my impression that there needs to be a clarification of the    effect of *print-level* and *print-length*, so if this impression is    correct, I will volunteer to write it up. Basically, there seems to be a    confusion about whether it is the actual components of the object that    count or what the object looks like when printed in list notation. For    example, the levels of 'x and (quote x) are considered different (cf    page 373) but string-char arrays of rank >1 are affected by    *print-length* even when printed in non-list notation (cf page 369).    Other cases that are affected by this distinction include    - a structure with n components has 2n+1 elements in its printed list    representation    - nil vs. ()    - a rank 0 array has a component but prints with no parentheses whereas    a 0xN array has 2 levels of parens and no components, etc.    Since I am obviously not as well-qualified as the rest of the    clean-up committee to judge such issues, and since I don't have access    to any other preliminary feedback, there does not seem to be much point    in my proceeding with writing up something like this until further    notice.        A suggestion for a change that I have is that some of the defstruct    arguments be strings instead of symbols, but I also don't know if    there's any point in entertaining it.    I was under the impression at the meeting Monday that thecleanu-up    committee was going to suggest setting up several other committees,    including one on the file systems handling, but when I reminded Larry on    Wednesday, he said there weren't any that hadn't already been set up, so    I am unsure of the status of the situation regarding a file    subcommittee. ...*start*03176 00024 US Return-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 27 JUL 87 18:05:35 PDTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 27 Jul 87  18:02:42 PDTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Mon 27 Jul 87 21:02:34-EDTDate: Mon, 27 Jul 87 21:02 EDTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12321827954.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

Fahlman <Fahlman>To:   loop-groop%clam at SUN.COMcc:   fahlmanRe:   Iteration standardOK, apparently this is the proper address for iteration discussions.Here's what I wanted to say (probably an anticlimax at this point):In the past, I have always been a vocal opponent of adopting the MITLOOP macro, or anything very close to it, as a part of the Common Lispstandard.  I think that the basic functionality of LOOP is OK, and I'vegot no real problem with its lack of a clean unifying abstraction; myobjection was that the cute, non-Lispy, pseudo-English infix/keywordsyntax was confusing and not in keeping with the rest of the language orthe direction in which Lisp should be moving.  My hope was that if westalled this decision for a while, someone would come up with somethingbetter and that that "something better" would catch on in somesignificant segment of the community.  (This strategy turned out to be agood one with respect to object-oriented programming and old-styleflavors.)Well, I've mellowed on this.  Personally, I would still rather seesomething like(loop (for i 0 100 2)      (while (non-prime-p (foobar i))      (collect (flowers-in-may))      (finally (print *famous-last-words*)))than the non-parenthesized run-on sentence equivalent, but we've beenhung up on this difference of opinion for five years and I'm ready tothrow in the towel.  Nothing else has caught on, and in the meantimeLOOP has consolidated its position and started to spread.  It IS betterthan nothing.  The people who use it seem to like it.  Whenpretty-printed properly it is readable enough -- I can blur my eyes andpretend that the missing parens are there.So, speaking only for myself, I would be willing to accept and evensupport LOOP or something very similar as long as (1) it is cleanlydefined and (2) someone provides a portable, efficient public-domainimplementation.  In my view, it's time to settle this and move on.Of course, I can't speak for the other people who still find LOOP syntaxdisgusting.  Maybe some of the others are ready to compromise as well.I was discussing this with Stan Shebs of Utah -- another former LOOPShater, probably because he was a fan of PSL's FOR macro -- and he wasalso ready to bow to the inevitable.  Those who favor a more uniform andprincipled approach to the whole iteration business -- the fans of LetS,for example -- may be harder to please.-- Scott*start*01531 00024 USaOriginator: @SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:sandra%orion%cs.utah:EDU:XeroxDate: 28 Aug 87 09:19From: sandra%orion%cs.utah:EDU:XeroxSubject: cleanup status?To: common-lisp%sail.stanford:EDU:XeroxGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVFrom: sandra%orion@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Subject: cleanup status?To: common-lisp@sail.stanford.eduReturn-Path: <@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU:sandra%orion@cs.utah.edu>Redistributed: Xerox-Common-Lisp^.xReceived: from SAIL.STANFORD.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 28 AUG 87 09:19:07 PDTReceived: from CS.UTAH.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 28 Aug 87  08:49:18 PDTReceived: by cs.utah.edu (5.54/utah-1.0)	id AA01843; Fri, 28 Aug 87 09:52:13 MDTReceived: by orion.utah.edu (5.54/utah-1.0-slave)	id AA15136; Fri, 28 Aug 87 09:52:09 MDTOriginal-Date: Fri, 28 Aug 87 09:52:09 MDTMessage-Id: <8708281552.AA15136@orion.utah.edu>GVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVHave there been any decisions made by the cleanup committee on issues thathave been previously hashed out in gory detail on this mailing list?

Results of thoseballots are reported in the X3J13 minutes.While a number of us read Common-lisp@Sail.stanford.edu, and wefrequently use it as a resource, there is no process by which issuesdiscussed on this list automatically become proposals for X3J13. Of the issues you mention, none of them have been brought up before thecleanup committee directly. I believe two of the issues you mention ("which DEFxxx forms should beprocessed at compile time", and "declarations in FLET/LABELS") awaitsome further input from other subcommittees.*start*00824 00024 USaReturn-Path: <sandra%orion@cs.utah.edu>Received: from cs.utah.edu by Xerox.COM ; 30 AUG 87 08:09:12 PDTReceived: by cs.utah.edu (5.54/utah-1.0)	id AA13463; Sun, 30 Aug 87 09:11:48 MDTReceived: by orion.utah.edu (5.54/utah-1.0-slave)	id AA20111; Sun, 30 Aug 87 09:11:38 MDTDate: Sun, 30 Aug 87 09:11:38 MDTFrom: sandra%orion@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Message-Id: <8708301511.AA20111@orion.utah.edu>Subject: Re: cleanup status?To: Masinter.paIn-Reply-To: Masinter.pa@Xerox.COM, 29 Aug 87 16:19 PDTThat wasn't really what I was asking about.

Mondayhas been set aside for committee meetings, followed by the main meeting onTuesday and Wednesday.  November is the perfect time to see fall (andsometimes winter) in Colorado.  Rocky Mountain National Park isapproximately one hour from Fort Collins.Hewlett-Packard's travel affiliate, Lifeco Travel, has negotiated discountairfares that you can obtain by calling:	800-521-8858 (in California)	800-722-8755 (elsewhere)Ask to make a group reservation for X3J13.  You may also make your room,rental car, or airport limousine reservations through Lifeco at the sametime.  Payment must be made by credit card.  Tickets will be mailed viaregistered mail.  Late reservations can be express mailed at additionalcost.A block of rooms is available at the University Park Holiday Inn at $46.50plus tax per night.  If you don't make reservations through Lifeco Travel,please make your own reservations by calling (303)482-2626 and asking toreserve a room in the "HP X3J13" block.  Reservations will be held until 6PM unless guaranteed by a major credit card.  Non-smoking rooms areavailable.  Check-in and check-out times are 1 PM.  The block of rooms willbe dropped on 11/2/87, but you should still be able to obtain thediscounted room rate on available rooms if you specify you are attendingthe the "HP X3J13" conference.Refreshments and lunch are being arranged for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Iexpect these arrangements will run $50 or less per person which I willcollect at the meeting.  I should be able to update this value in a fewweeks.  Please note any dietary restrictions so I can make the necessaryarrangements with the catering department.If there is sufficient interest I would like to arrange a dinner Tuesdayevening at Cuisine, Cuisine.  Cuisine, Cuisine is an intimate cafe offeringsome the best and most unusual food in Northern Colorado.  It is a verysmall cafe which can only accommodate 60 total patrons, but they arewilling to put together a special banquet for us. To handle a group thislarge in a short period of time they would like to limit the menu to 4items.  The list of possible entrees includes: Cajun roast duckling withspice peach gravy, chicken boursin (double breast of chicken stuffed withherbed cream cheese dressing and mushroom voloute' sauce), shrimp diane(sauteed jumbo shrimp in a garlic cajun sauce), sirloin tips with mushroomsand onions, poached salmon with a special sauce, or boned leg of lambstuffed with spinach and served with a dijon sauce.  A vegetarian entreewill also be available.  Entrees would be about 15 dollars, including soupor salad.  Appetizers, dessert, and beverage would be ala carte.  Cuisine,Cuisine accepts charge cards, but cash would also be welcome.I would need to narrow this to the four items at least 2 weeks in advanceso they could make the necessary preparations.  Note if you are interestedon the registration form and mark your first and second choice entrees.Please note any dietary restrictions if this selection is not sufficient.Fort Collins is approximately a one hour drive from Denver's StapletonInternational Airport.  From the airport take I-270 or I-70 west to I-25and go north on I-25 towards Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Take the first FortCollins exit, #265, turn left and drive 5 miles to the College Avenueintersection.  Turn right and drive 3 miles to the Prospect Roadintersection.  Turn left and the Holiday Inn is just across the railroadtracks on the south side of the road.  It shouldn't be hard to see since itis 8 stories tall in an area with very few building over 2 stories.Two limousine services provide shuttle service from Stapleton directly tothe Holiday Inn.  Fort Collins Express (303-482-0505) leaves Stapleton onthe hour while the Front Range Airporter (303-221-5466) leaves Stapleton onthe half hour.  Both are located in the baggage claim area.  The charge is$12 each way on the Express and $13 on the Airporter.               |     Prospect Road                           ||                =========|======================                       ||           HI  |                                             ||            M              |                                             ||            O              |                                             ||            U              |                                             ||           N              |     Drake Road                 North        ||            T     =========|======================           /\          ||A              |                                 ||          ||            I              |US 287/ College Avenue                       ||           N              |                                             ||I-25       S              |                                             ||                           |     Horsetooth Road                         ||               =========|======================                       ||               |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |     Harmony Road                  HP       /||\       =========|=============================================||===========               |                                            \||/ Exit 265                 |                                             ||                                                                         ||                                                                         \/                                                                         Denver                                                                                                                                                                  Please return the following registration form by November 2 via electronicmail to dcm%hpfclp@hplabs.hp.com or via US Mail to:	Dave Matthews	Hewlett-Packard Company	3404 E Harmony Road	Fort Collins, Colorado  80525	(303)339-2201Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.__________________________________________________________________________	       X3J13 NOVEMBER MEETING REGISTRATION FORM                                           Name:			__________________________________________________Institution:		__________________________________________________Street Address:		__________________________________________________City, State, Zip:	__________________________________________________Phone:			__________________________________________________Network Address:	__________________________________________________Dinner	11/17 (y/n):	__________________________________________________	First choice:	__________________________________________________	Second choice:	__________________________________________________	(Duck, chicken, shrimp, sirloin, salmon, lamb, vegetarian)Dietary Restrictions:  	__________________________________________________                      		  	__________________________________________________		  	__________________________________________________*start*01174 00024 US Return-Path: <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Received: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 22 SEP 87 13:48:18 PDTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU>; Tue 22 Sep 87 16:46:39-EDTDate: Tue, 22 Sep 87 16:46 EDTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12336723575.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

This is my "working copy":This file contains a list of issues and proposals for the X3J13 cleanupcommittee to consider.  It is broken into several sections, divided by aline of ='s.* Editorial changes: items that merely clarify what must currently be   decyphered out of CLtL; not changes to Common Lisp but to the language   describing it.* Simple clarifications: items that are unclear, contradictory, or  underspecified in CLtL.  In these cases, the proper fix seems obvious.* Complex clarifications: these may require a bit more discussion.* Simple changes: proposed small changes that may or may not be  desirable.* Complex changes: these are more complex or fundamental changes that  will probably require extensive discussion.  Some of them require the  development of a specific proposal.* Proposed additions: these are additions or compatible extensions that  may or may not be worth adding to the language.  Some of them require  the development of specific proposals.  In general, these are less  urgent than the clarifications and proposed changes.* Issues to pass along to the compiler committee.The clarifications on Steele's list of Jan, 1986, are included hereexcept for those that have been withdrawn or extensively modified bylater discussion.  The initial judgements about which issues are simpleand which are complex were made by Scott Fahlman, who has frequentlybeen wrong about such things in the past.This file does not currently reflect proposals made after the August1986 Lisp conference.  The formal proposals discussed just before theLisp conference are included here, more or less as place-holders.  Ihave not yet dug through the relevant mail to find all of the optionsand amendments that were proposed in the course of discussion.The plan is to have the "cleanup" subcommittee of X3J13 turn theseissues into a series of proposals that will be sent to the Clisp mailinglist for comment, then to the full X3J13 committee, which will considerwhether to include these changes in the forthcoming Common Lispstandard.Editorial changes:---------------------------------------------------------------------------(p ???)Modify the general rule about operating only on active elements of arrays to exclude ADJUST-ARRAY, SETF of AREF, ROW-MAJOR-AREF, and SETF of ROW-MAJOR-AREF.---------------------------------------------------------------------------p ???Modify the description of APROPOS to replace the words ``available in'' to``accessible in,'' and specify that APROPOS on a given package finds thesame symbols that DO-SYMBOLS would.---------------------------------------------------------------------------"Throughout: Adopt the term "special operator" for the symbol thatintroduces a special form, leaving "special form" to refer to the wholeform. Note that the name SPECIAL-FORM-P is not quite accurate, since it acts on the symbols that introduce forms rather than the forms themselves."p 274: Clarify by example that NSUBST-IF-NOT is perhaps non-intuitive:    (let* ((item-list '(numbers (1.0 2 5/3) symbols (foo bar)))	   (new (nsubst-if-not '3.1415 #'numberp item-list)))      (values new item-list))    => 3.1415---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 113:Clarify that the bindings created by FLET and LABELS have lexical scopeand indefinite extent.  The functions themselves have indefinite extent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 426:Make explicit that when a compiled file is loaded, symbols naminglexical variables in the code may or may not be created.  This is left upto the implementation.===========================================================================SIMPLE CLARIFICATIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 379:Specify that PEEK-CHAR operations on echo streams should not echo.  Theecho occurs when the character is actually read.  (We may have to add "onsystems which can manage this", since there may be some that cannot.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 404:Specify that the ~< ... ~> directives to FORMAT divide the whitespaceevenly into the gaps between the units of text.  Any remaining quanta ofwhitespace are distributed into gaps from left to right, not placedrandomly.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 140:Clarify that in an UNWIND-PROTECT, the cleanup forms are executed in thedynamic environment of the UNWIND-PROTECT itself.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 51:Clarify that coerce MAY NOT copy the argument if it is already of thecorrect type.  (At present, the manual is inconsistent on whether a copyis allowed.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 426:Clarify what the :VERBOSE and :PRINT options to LOAD do, or at least whattheir intent is.One proposal, by SEF:1. Load with no switches should not print anything on standard-output.2. The :verbose switch is intended to print some per-file informationand an indication when the loading is done, but not something for everyform that is loaded.3. The :print switch is intended to cause the read/eval/print loop'soutput to be printed, or if the file is compiled, something for eachform that is loaded.4. These are only guidelines covering the intent of how these switchesare to be used.  Implementations are free to indicate this kind ofinformation in other ways if that makes sense in their environment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 67:Clarify that argument-list init-forms are NOT lexically within the blockestablished by the Defun of which they are a part.  (Most implementationshave done it this way.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 422:Clarify that WITH-OPEN-FILE returns the value(s) of the last form in thebody.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 200, 215:Clarification: Division by 0 should be documented to be an error.  Itdoesn't seem to be at present.[For flonums, maybe allow IEEE-type infinities here.  Wait for errorproposal before discussing whether error must be signalled and how.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 50, 307:Clarification: It is an error to redefine an built-in type via DEFSTRUCT orDEFTYPE.  [Coordinate with object proposal.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 316:Clarify that if a defstruct specifies a BOA constructor, the defaultkeyword-style constructor is not also defined.  (OR clarify that it is.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 280:Clarify that the :KEY argument to ASSOC is applied to the car of each list,not the whole pair.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 104:In the description of the second value of a setf method:    A list of *value forms* (subforms of the given form) to whose values    the temporary values are to be bound.preface the parentheical remark with "often" or "usually".  It is notalways true, as in the following example:    (DEFMACRO ELT-IF (SEQ PRED IND1 IND2)	`(ELT ,SEQ (IF ,PRED ,IND1 ,IND2)))The setf method of (ELT2 S P A B) is defined to be the same as that of(ELT S (IF P A B)).  There is no way to express the setf method of thisform in terms of the values of subforms of (ELT2 S P A B), since A andB are not always evaluated.  In the implementations I have checked, thesetf method of (ELT2 S P A B) has value forms S and (IF P A B).The current statement is also harmful if read as a prescription forDEFINE-SETF-METHOD, since it is then impossible to define SETF methodsfor forms that do not always evaluate all of their arguments.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 130:Specify that constant forms such as strings may appear at top-level in atagbody, but that only symbols and integers are considered to be tags.It is an error to use anything else as the destination tag for a GO.Specify that it is an error for the same (EQL) tag to appear more thanonce in the body of a TAGBODY.  (However, a TAGBODY may have the sametag as another TAGBODY in which it nests, in which case the tag in theouter TAGBODY is shadowed, as already specified.)===========================================================================COMPLEX CLARIFICATIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:It is not specified what happens when the same (EQL) variable appears morethan once in a lambda-list or binding form (LET, LET*, etc.).  This wasdiscussed at some length in June/July 1986.  Possible options:1. It is an error.2. Latest (rightmost) binding governs in all forms.3. It is an error in parallel-binding forms and lambdas, but rightmost   governs in serial-binding forms such as LET*.[Related issue: special dispensation to allow multiple uses of ignoredvariables?  Bring back IGNORE as a universally-ignored variable?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 68:(merge with LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION)Clarify that using DEFCONSTANT to redefine any constant described in theCommon Lisp specification is an error.Clarify that if the user defines a constant, compiles code that refersto that constant, and then redefines the constant, then behavior of thecompiled code may be unpredictable.  It is an error to execute suchcode.Clarify that it is not an error to issue a second DEFCONSTANT commandfor an existing constant iff the new value is EQL to the old one.[Needed for reloading compiled code files.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 413, 424:The semantics of TRUENAME and PROBE-FILE on open streamsneeds to be clarified.  The requirement that PROBE-FILE never returnNIL on an open file is clearly broken.  Spice Lisp currentlyimplements TRUENAME and PROBE-FILE in the same way, except thatTRUENAME errors instead of returning NIL.  Someone (Moon, I believe)suggested that (PROBE-FILE <stream>) was the same as (PROBE-FILE (PATHNAME <stream>)), but that (TRUENAME <stream>) wassomehow different.  There also needs to be some discussion of themeaning of operations on closed streams.  The manual never says whichoperations may be done on closed streams, let alone what theoperations do.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Define carefully which returned values may be shared structure.  Thesemust not be destructively modified (or should be copied if you want tobe safe).  Symbol name-strings, rest-arg lists...---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 93:Clarify that MACROLET shadows any setf function for the associated macro:  (DEFUN LOSER (X)    (CAR X)  (DEFUN SET-LOSER (X Y)    (SETF (CAR X) Y))  (DEFSETF LOSER SET-LOSER)  (DEFUN LOSSAGE (X Y)    (MACROLET ((LOSER (X)	         `(SYMBOL-VALUE ,X)))      (SETF (LOSER X) Y)))LOSSAGE calls SET, not SET-LOSER.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 113:Clarify that FLET shadows DEFMACRO. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 321:Modify EVAL to have an optional environment argument.[I think this is unwise. -- SEF]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 440:Specify explicitly that one may trace macros as well as functions.[Is this feasible in all implementations? CF CLOS trace proposal]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 80:Clarify what EQUAL and EQUALP do on structures.  Proposal: If thestructures are of the same type, both EQUAL and EQUALP do component-wisecomparison.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 112:Clarify Compiler-Let or flush it.  [SEF: Flush it.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 389:Need a portable way to print a #\SPACE as " ".  (FORMAT NIL "~C"#\Space) may or may not do this.  Same with PRINC.  For Standardcharacters, it is safe to be more specific about how things are printed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 160:Either specify that IGNOREd arguments do not generate a warning if youuse them after all, or add a new declaration IGNORABLE.[Stupid issue, discussed to death earlier.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 295:Proposed clarifications regarding fill pointers:  If no fill pointer is specified to Make-Array, the implementaiton is    not required to supply a fill-pointer, but may do so.  If a destructive sequence function such as DELETE is passed an array    with a fill pointer, it may change the active size of the array by    manipulating the fill pointer; it is not required that the underlying    array's ARRAY-DIMENSION be altered.  If ADJUST-ARRAY is called on a vector with a fill pointer, but is not    given a :FILL-POINTER argument, the fill-pointer is retained and is    reset to the new length of the vector.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 249 and elsewhere:What is the effect of giving circular lists to MAP, MAPCAR, SOME,EVERY, etc.?  Specify that it is an error, or require it to work?[ There's a real split on this issue.  To some people, circular listsare a clever hack and this obviously should work.  To others, they arean evil that should not be encouraged.  SEF and GLS have argued in favorof treating this as an error. ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 307:Does COPY-FOO (where foo is a structure) work on subtypes that includeFOO?  Does COPY-PERSON work on ASTRONAUT?[Subsumed by object proposal?  Gregor suggests: COPY-xxx as defined by adefstruct returns a structure of that defstruct's type.  COPY returns astructure of the same type as its argument.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 152:Clarify (figure out) how MACROLET and *MACROEXPAND-HOOK* interact.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 447:Clarify by example what sort of thing goes intoLISP-IMPLEMENTATION-TYPE, etc.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Clarify the ways in which an implementation may extend pure Common Lisp:Extra keywords to specified functions?  To all functions?  Extra returnvalues?  Functions working on otherwise illegal types?  Require a compilermode that catches non-Common stuff?  Should we document certain specificfunctions (e.g. COMPILE) as allowing implementation-specific keywordextensions. (cf IF-BODY discussion)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Chapter 23:Pathnames and the file system interface require much clarification andprobably some changes.  A comprehensive proposal is needed here.The Symbolics solution might work for us.  If we can't fix this up, weshould consider dumping the whole thing and going with something verysimple and minimal, such as a raw string in system-specific format todesignate a file.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 145:Specify that the &REST or &BODY argument to a macro may be the very listfrom the macro call, and not a copy, and therefore the user should notperform destructive operations on it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 60:Decide whether an &rest arg is required to be a freshly-consed list orwhether it may be part of a pre-existing list passed in by APPLY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 162:Decide what the behavior of (THE (VALUES ...) form) should be.  Does itspecify exactly how many values should be returned, or a lower limit, orwhat?One proposal: in (THE (VALUES ...) form), the form may return morevalues, but not fewer, than the number of types specified in the (VALUES...) form, and any extra values are of unrestricted type.Also specify that (THE type form) where type is not (VALUES ...) isequivalent to (THE (VALUES type) form).[Discussed June/July 1986.]===========================================================================SIMPLE CHANGES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 239:Change CHAR-EQUAL, CHAR-NOT-EQUAL, CHAR-LESSP, CHAR-GREATERP,CHAR-NOT-LESSP, and CHAR-NOT-GREATERP to consider two characters to bedifferent if their bits attributes are different.[May be subsumed under a wholesale redesign of character objects,eliminating the BIT and FONT attributes. Character committee??]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 202:Define (LCM) to return 1 (the manual is incorrect in claiming that theresult should be infinity).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 377:Extend READ-DELIMITED-LIST by adding one more optional argument,dot-permitted-p, defaulting to nil, that if true allows the delimited listto contain dot notation, and if false forbids dot notation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 323:Eliminate the ENV argument to APPLYHOOK, which is useless.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 418:Flush :DIRECTION :PROBE as an allowable argument to OPEN.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 171 ff:All functions that take a package as an argument, except thosenamed PACKAGE-xxx, will also take a string or symbol and do an implicitfind-package.  This gives users maximum flexibility and minimum confusion.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 316:BOA constructors take keywords, with the obvious semantics.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 251:(reduce #'+ list-of-objects :KEY #'object-quantity) would apply thefunction OBJECT-QUANTITY to each element of the list-of-objects beforereducing it with +.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 327:Functions that require a string, pathname, stream, or symbolshould not accept a symbol.  NIL is confusing, and some implementationsuse symbols for certain streams.  [Proposal by Moon]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 305:Require that structures (created without the :TYPE specifier) aredisjoint from the other built-in types such as vector?  They alreadymust be distinguishable from plain old vectors.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Forbid implementations to produce unsolicited output to*standard-ouput*.  Output to *error-ouput* is always OK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 444:In the description of Decoded Time format, the Time-zone component isrequired to be an integer which is the number of hours west of GMT.(The latest term is Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, by the way).Since time zones are not always an integral number of hours west of GMT,this should be changed to either (a) a non-complex, non-negative numberwhich is the number of hours west of GMT, or (b) an integer which is thenumber of {minutes, seconds} west of GMT.===========================================================================COMPLEX CHANGES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 210:Change the branch cuts of the ATAN function to follow W. Kahan'srecommendations.  (Paul Penfield intends to recommend the same change tothe APL community.)  [Steele should produce a specific proposal without forwarding pointers.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 181:There must be a package with only the official Common Lisp symbols,either named LISP or COMMON-LISP.  Work out whereimplementation-specific extensions go.  Several proposals exist.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 80:EQUAL should descend into arrays, if they are the same type anddimensionality, comparing leaves by EQL.[SEF: I was partly to blame for the decision not to do this.  I nowbelieve that we blew it here, and should consider un-blowing it.  Thechange will break some code, but the community might accept it anyway.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 26, 42:Alter the LIST type-specifier to distinguish proper lists from others andto specify the element-type of the list.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 93:Flush MACROLET, thereby doing away with environment arguments and relatedconfusion.[This has been proposed N times and rejected each time on the grounds thatMACROLET is not *totally* useless, but I still think that this is the rightthing to do. -- SEF]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 154:Eliminate the provision that a macro at the start of a body may expandinto a declaration.[KMP, who was one of the more vocal proponents of this feature, hasnow suggested that we consider flushing it.  It requires some confusingenvironment hackery to do this right.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 322:Flush *applyhook* and *evalhook* and related hackery.  Does anyone usethis (correctly) for anything other than implementing steppers?  If not,it may be preferable to forget about portable stepper hooks and makestepping an implementaiton-dependent facility like DEBUG.  These hookscause an awful lot of confusion and anxiety for users and implementors.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 153:Proposed alterations to SPECIAL declaration and possible addition ofUNSPECIAL (see Common Lisp mail around July 1986 including proposal byPavel).  One or more coherent proposals have to be constructed forconsideration.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 58:Turn the warning that standard macros should not expand intonon-standard special forms into a requirement.  Makes life easier forcode-walkers.[Can all implemenations live with this?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Three related, controversial proposals on case-sensitivity for symbols. 1)  Add a switch that would tell read and friends to suppress caseconversion, along with a note indicating that portable code assumes thisswitch to be OFF.  [SEF: This is the proposal dear to the unix people.  I still think thatit is asking for trouble to put this in.  Some code will assume thisswitch despite the warning, some won't, and the two kinds of code willnot mix.]2) Alternatively, think again about making the language case-preserving,but with INTERN ignoring case completely.  This means that there is *NO*way to create two symbols, one named "FOO" and the other named "foo",but now that we have strings this may not be necessary.[SEF: I now believe that this is what we should have done, but it isprobably too radical a change to consider at this point.]3) Add a property of read tables which tell whether READ under the read table preserves case.  READ-CHAR is not affected.[LMM: This is the way Xerox Lisp handles it, and it works very well. It puts case sensitivity where it belongs, as part of the read-table description.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 171:Even if we keep the status quo for symbols, we may want to reconsiderthe rules on case-sensitivity for package names.  Need a specificproposal and analysis of transition strategy.[LMM: this is unnecessary, I think.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 382:How to communicate the current depth in printing when there areuser-defined print functions?  Guy said that what had in mind was thatthe user would bind *print-level* according to the depth arg supplied tothe print function, but there were several problems with this.  Most ofthe tasteful solutions involved adding new args to WRITE which indicatedthe nature of the recursive use of the printer.  Others objected thatnobody wants to use WRITE directly, so that isn't a real fix.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Chapter 13:[Not in cleanup committee....]We need a comprehensive proposal for handling extended characters(16-bit char-code, plus possibly other fields) and strings of extendedcharacters.  The Japanese are developing a Kanji standard.  Maybe wecan just adopt this; certainly we must coordinate with it.At the same time, consider whether to retain the char-bit and char-fontfileds in present form.  Since an implementaiton may omit these fields,this should not break truly portable code.===========================================================================PROPOSED ADDITIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???Add a new function TYPE-SPECIFIER-P that is true of valid typespecifiers and false of all other Lisp objects.  Note that the use ofDEFSTRUCT and DEFTYPE can change the behavior of TYPE-SPECIFIER-P overtime. (Discussed by not good results).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 226:Add SIGNED-LDB.  Like LDB but sign-extends the extracted byte.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 283:Add functions HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE, HASH-TABLE-REHASH-THRESHOLD,HASH-TABLE-SIZE, and HASH-TABLE-TEST each take a hash table and returnthe appropriate current information.[ Which, if any, are SETF-able?  What does hash-table-test return, thefunction object for the test function? ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 439:Add COMPILEDP.  This takes a function and returns non-NIL if it is acompiled function, and NIL if it is not.  If the function is a symbolwhose compiled-function definition was installed by the COMPILEfunction, then the non-NIL value returned is the interpreted definitionthat was compiled.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 439: Add UNCOMPILE.  This takes a symbol and restores the previousinterpreted definition of that symbol if that symbol previously had aninterpreted definition and was then given to COMPILE; otherwise noaction is taken.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 447:Add USER-NAME.  This returns a string identifying the user of the CommonLisp system, or NIL if that cannot be determined.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 327:Add *DISCARD-OUTPUT-STREAM* (alias, the bit bucket).[Make this a constant so that it can be optimized?  You should never wantto rebind this to another value.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 117:Add (CASE-WITH-TEST test item ...clauses...).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 51:Extension: Let COERCE coerce symbols to strings.  NIL is treated as theempty sequence, not a symbol.  Also let COERCE turn string-chars intostrings of length 1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Add TRUE and FALSE, functions that take any number of args, ignore them,and return T and NIL respectively.Someplace:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 95, 267:Add SETF of NTHCDR.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 158:Add a TYPE-RESTRICT declaration.  (TYPE-RESTRICT type1 type2), wheretype2 is a subtype of type1, says that within the scope of thedeclaration if the compiler can prove a value is of type1, it isallowed to assume that it is of type2.  This gets rid of a lot ofmultiple-THE forms when you want maximally tense code.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 73:Fill out the set of mumble-P type predicates.  Currently we have someand not others.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:We need a set of "undoing" functions, so that interactive errors andfailed experiments can be recovered from without starting over.See comprehensive proposal by Eric Benson.[SEF: A generic "undo" facility, like SETF, has been opposed on variousoccasions, but is a bad idea because users will expect too much of it,and complain when it doesn't undo everything.][cf DEFINITION-FUNCTIONS, in prep]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 336:Add (syntax-type <character>), which returns one of the following::illegal, :whitespace, :constituent, :single-escape, :multiple-escape,:terminating-macro, :non-terminating-macro.[Make this setf-able?  If so, what do we do about macro characters thathave no definitions?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 283:Add EQUALP hash-tables?  Case-insensitive hash-tables for strings?  Letthe user provide his own test (with associated hashing function)?  [Needa coherent proposal.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Have a function COPY that can copy any single object.  For a CONS cellit would copy just that CONS.  Whether (EQ X (COPY X)) for X a characteror number is implementation-dependent.[Proposal in archives by Morrison, needs some tuning.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 171:We need a way to say "use all the symbols from package FOO except for X,Y, ..."  Shadowing is no good, since you might want to inherit X fromsomewhere else.  Also, do we want a make-package that says ALL symbolsget exported?---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Fahlman's proposal for &more arguments, similar to &rest but leaves thearguments on the stack LEXPR-style.  Removes one of the worst inherentefficiency problems in Common Lisp.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 438:Review and develop a general philosophy on the handling of semi-standardsystem interface functions such as GC, BYE, ED, SAVE-SYSTEM, etc.  Thensee what we want to add (or remove).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Consider FUNCTION-PARAMETERS and related proposals that were discussedextensively in June/July 1986.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Consider PARSE-BODY and extended syntax for &BODY, as discussed inJune/July 1986.[Note, if we flush MACROLET or eliminate macro-expansion intodeclarations, this extension becomes less critical, though it may stillbe useful.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 154:Permit declarations before the body of a LABELS, FLET, or MACROLET.===========================================================================For the compiler committee:---------------------------------------------------------------------------A lot of compiler/eval-when issues need to be settled.  Among theissues: Define clearly how REQUIRE interacts with the compiler.  AreDEFSETF-generated available in the compiler environment by default?---------------------------------------------------------------------------Package interactions with COMPILE and LOAD need to be worked out better.Restrict IN-PACKAGE, IMPORT, and firends to the start of files only?Add a new declarative form to handle this?  Some favor legitimzing -*-forms, but this is unacceptable to many.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Related issue: Add INCLUDE, or some other way to stuff multiple sourcefiles into one binary?  (Package hackery makes this complicated.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Related issue: There should be some discussion of the semantics ofcompilation on literal constants (things appearing in quoted structurein code).  To what degree is sharing and non-sharing preserved?  Manyimplementations both introduce and remove sharing.  Probably most don'tdump circular structures.---------------------------------------------------------------------------What things can a compiler optimize by inline expansion, tail-recursionelimination, etc.?  What things must be handled correctly if the userredefines a built-in function (or specializes it using the objectfacility)?Proto-proposal: All built-in functions may be optimized inline(and therefore do not respond to later modifcation) unless this isinhibited with a NOTINLINE declaration.  Maybe create a list offunctions such as PRINT that are not open-coded by default.  Also,within a DEFUN, a recursive call to the function being defined may beoptimizied into a jump, unless this is inhibited by NOTINLINE.  (Maybethink up a better term than NOTINLINE.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW:Declare *print-circle* means to print out shared structure too. Alternative: add another variable *print-shared*. Alternative: add another value to *print-circle* (nil :none   t :unspecified :circular :shared).*start*34781 00024 US Date: 22 Sep 87 15:16 PDTFrom: Masinter.pato: masinterSubject: status: remaining ISSUES.TXT file[sent 22-Sep-87 15:16:36]For the record, this is the remainder of the issues file that Scott worked on -- was it 1.5 years ago -- that I don't believe have made it into proposals yet. This is my "working copy":This file contains a list of issues and proposals for the X3J13 cleanupcommittee to consider.  It is broken into several sections, divided by aline of ='s.* Editorial changes: items that merely clarify what must currently be   decyphered out of CLtL; not changes to Common Lisp but to the language   describing it.* Simple clarifications: items that are unclear, contradictory, or  underspecified in CLtL.  In these cases, the proper fix seems obvious.* Complex clarifications: these may require a bit more discussion.* Simple changes: proposed small changes that may or may not be  desirable.* Complex changes: these are more complex or fundamental changes that  will probably require extensive discussion.  Some of them require the  development of a specific proposal.* Proposed additions: these are additions or compatible extensions that  may or may not be worth adding to the language.  Some of them require  the development of specific proposals.  In general, these are less  urgent than the clarifications and proposed changes.* Issues to pass along to the compiler committee.The clarifications on Steele's list of Jan, 1986, are included hereexcept for those that have been withdrawn or extensively modified bylater discussion.  The initial judgements about which issues are simpleand which are complex were made by Scott Fahlman, who has frequentlybeen wrong about such things in the past.This file does not currently reflect proposals made after the August1986 Lisp conference.  The formal proposals discussed just before theLisp conference are included here, more or less as place-holders.  Ihave not yet dug through the relevant mail to find all of the optionsand amendments that were proposed in the course of discussion.The plan is to have the "cleanup" subcommittee of X3J13 turn theseissues into a series of proposals that will be sent to the Clisp mailinglist for comment, then to the full X3J13 committee, which will considerwhether to include these changes in the forthcoming Common Lispstandard.Editorial changes:---------------------------------------------------------------------------(p ???)Modify the general rule about operating only on active elements of arrays to exclude ADJUST-ARRAY, SETF of AREF, ROW-MAJOR-AREF, and SETF of ROW-MAJOR-AREF.---------------------------------------------------------------------------p ???Modify the description of APROPOS to replace the words ``available in'' to``accessible in,'' and specify that APROPOS on a given package finds thesame symbols that DO-SYMBOLS would.---------------------------------------------------------------------------"Throughout: Adopt the term "special operator" for the symbol thatintroduces a special form, leaving "special form" to refer to the wholeform. Note that the name SPECIAL-FORM-P is not quite accurate, since it acts on the symbols that introduce forms rather than the forms themselves."p 274: Clarify by example that NSUBST-IF-NOT is perhaps non-intuitive:    (let* ((item-list '(numbers (1.0 2 5/3) symbols (foo bar)))	   (new (nsubst-if-not '3.1415 #'numberp item-list)))      (values new item-list))    => 3.1415---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 113:Clarify that the bindings created by FLET and LABELS have lexical scopeand indefinite extent.  The functions themselves have indefinite extent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 426:Make explicit that when a compiled file is loaded, symbols naminglexical variables in the code may or may not be created.  This is left upto the implementation.===========================================================================SIMPLE CLARIFICATIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 379:Specify that PEEK-CHAR operations on echo streams should not echo.  Theecho occurs when the character is actually read.  (We may have to add "onsystems which can manage this", since there may be some that cannot.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 404:Specify that the ~< ... ~> directives to FORMAT divide the whitespaceevenly into the gaps between the units of text.  Any remaining quanta ofwhitespace are distributed into gaps from left to right, not placedrandomly.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 140:Clarify that in an UNWIND-PROTECT, the cleanup forms are executed in thedynamic environment of the UNWIND-PROTECT itself.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 51:Clarify that coerce MAY NOT copy the argument if it is already of thecorrect type.  (At present, the manual is inconsistent on whether a copyis allowed.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 426:Clarify what the :VERBOSE and :PRINT options to LOAD do, or at least whattheir intent is.One proposal, by SEF:1. Load with no switches should not print anything on standard-output.2. The :verbose switch is intended to print some per-file informationand an indication when the loading is done, but not something for everyform that is loaded.3. The :print switch is intended to cause the read/eval/print loop'soutput to be printed, or if the file is compiled, something for eachform that is loaded.4. These are only guidelines covering the intent of how these switchesare to be used.  Implementations are free to indicate this kind ofinformation in other ways if that makes sense in their environment.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 67:Clarify that argument-list init-forms are NOT lexically within the blockestablished by the Defun of which they are a part.  (Most implementationshave done it this way.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 422:Clarify that WITH-OPEN-FILE returns the value(s) of the last form in thebody.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 200, 215:Clarification: Division by 0 should be documented to be an error.  Itdoesn't seem to be at present.[For flonums, maybe allow IEEE-type infinities here.  Wait for errorproposal before discussing whether error must be signalled and how.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 50, 307:Clarification: It is an error to redefine an built-in type via DEFSTRUCT orDEFTYPE.  [Coordinate with object proposal.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 316:Clarify that if a defstruct specifies a BOA constructor, the defaultkeyword-style constructor is not also defined.  (OR clarify that it is.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 280:Clarify that the :KEY argument to ASSOC is applied to the car of each list,not the whole pair.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 104:In the description of the second value of a setf method:    A list of *value forms* (subforms of the given form) to whose values    the temporary values are to be bound.preface the parentheical remark with "often" or "usually".  It is notalways true, as in the following example:    (DEFMACRO ELT-IF (SEQ PRED IND1 IND2)	`(ELT ,SEQ (IF ,PRED ,IND1 ,IND2)))The setf method of (ELT2 S P A B) is defined to be the same as that of(ELT S (IF P A B)).  There is no way to express the setf method of thisform in terms of the values of subforms of (ELT2 S P A B), since A andB are not always evaluated.  In the implementations I have checked, thesetf method of (ELT2 S P A B) has value forms S and (IF P A B).The current statement is also harmful if read as a prescription forDEFINE-SETF-METHOD, since it is then impossible to define SETF methodsfor forms that do not always evaluate all of their arguments.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 130:Specify that constant forms such as strings may appear at top-level in atagbody, but that only symbols and integers are considered to be tags.It is an error to use anything else as the destination tag for a GO.Specify that it is an error for the same (EQL) tag to appear more thanonce in the body of a TAGBODY.  (However, a TAGBODY may have the sametag as another TAGBODY in which it nests, in which case the tag in theouter TAGBODY is shadowed, as already specified.)===========================================================================COMPLEX CLARIFICATIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:It is not specified what happens when the same (EQL) variable appears morethan once in a lambda-list or binding form (LET, LET*, etc.).  This wasdiscussed at some length in June/July 1986.  Possible options:1. It is an error.2. Latest (rightmost) binding governs in all forms.3. It is an error in parallel-binding forms and lambdas, but rightmost   governs in serial-binding forms such as LET*.[Related issue: special dispensation to allow multiple uses of ignoredvariables?  Bring back IGNORE as a universally-ignored variable?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 68:(merge with LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION)Clarify that using DEFCONSTANT to redefine any constant described in theCommon Lisp specification is an error.Clarify that if the user defines a constant, compiles code that refersto that constant, and then redefines the constant, then behavior of thecompiled code may be unpredictable.  It is an error to execute suchcode.Clarify that it is not an error to issue a second DEFCONSTANT commandfor an existing constant iff the new value is EQL to the old one.[Needed for reloading compiled code files.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 413, 424:The semantics of TRUENAME and PROBE-FILE on open streamsneeds to be clarified.  The requirement that PROBE-FILE never returnNIL on an open file is clearly broken.  Spice Lisp currentlyimplements TRUENAME and PROBE-FILE in the same way, except thatTRUENAME errors instead of returning NIL.  Someone (Moon, I believe)suggested that (PROBE-FILE <stream>) was the same as (PROBE-FILE (PATHNAME <stream>)), but that (TRUENAME <stream>) wassomehow different.  There also needs to be some discussion of themeaning of operations on closed streams.  The manual never says whichoperations may be done on closed streams, let alone what theoperations do.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Define carefully which returned values may be shared structure.  Thesemust not be destructively modified (or should be copied if you want tobe safe).  Symbol name-strings, rest-arg lists...---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 93:Clarify that MACROLET shadows any setf function for the associated macro:  (DEFUN LOSER (X)    (CAR X)  (DEFUN SET-LOSER (X Y)    (SETF (CAR X) Y))  (DEFSETF LOSER SET-LOSER)  (DEFUN LOSSAGE (X Y)    (MACROLET ((LOSER (X)	         `(SYMBOL-VALUE ,X)))      (SETF (LOSER X) Y)))LOSSAGE calls SET, not SET-LOSER.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 113:Clarify that FLET shadows DEFMACRO. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 321:Modify EVAL to have an optional environment argument.[I think this is unwise. -- SEF]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 440:Specify explicitly that one may trace macros as well as functions.[Is this feasible in all implementations? CF CLOS trace proposal]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 80:Clarify what EQUAL and EQUALP do on structures.  Proposal: If thestructures are of the same type, both EQUAL and EQUALP do component-wisecomparison.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 112:Clarify Compiler-Let or flush it.  [SEF: Flush it.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 389:Need a portable way to print a #\SPACE as " ".  (FORMAT NIL "~C"#\Space) may or may not do this.  Same with PRINC.  For Standardcharacters, it is safe to be more specific about how things are printed.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 160:Either specify that IGNOREd arguments do not generate a warning if youuse them after all, or add a new declaration IGNORABLE.[Stupid issue, discussed to death earlier.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 295:Proposed clarifications regarding fill pointers:  If no fill pointer is specified to Make-Array, the implementaiton is    not required to supply a fill-pointer, but may do so.  If a destructive sequence function such as DELETE is passed an array    with a fill pointer, it may change the active size of the array by    manipulating the fill pointer; it is not required that the underlying    array's ARRAY-DIMENSION be altered.  If ADJUST-ARRAY is called on a vector with a fill pointer, but is not    given a :FILL-POINTER argument, the fill-pointer is retained and is    reset to the new length of the vector.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 249 and elsewhere:What is the effect of giving circular lists to MAP, MAPCAR, SOME,EVERY, etc.?  Specify that it is an error, or require it to work?[ There's a real split on this issue.  To some people, circular listsare a clever hack and this obviously should work.  To others, they arean evil that should not be encouraged.  SEF and GLS have argued in favorof treating this as an error. ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 307:Does COPY-FOO (where foo is a structure) work on subtypes that includeFOO?  Does COPY-PERSON work on ASTRONAUT?[Subsumed by object proposal?  Gregor suggests: COPY-xxx as defined by adefstruct returns a structure of that defstruct's type.  COPY returns astructure of the same type as its argument.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 152:Clarify (figure out) how MACROLET and *MACROEXPAND-HOOK* interact.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 447:Clarify by example what sort of thing goes intoLISP-IMPLEMENTATION-TYPE, etc.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Clarify the ways in which an implementation may extend pure Common Lisp:Extra keywords to specified functions?  To all functions?  Extra returnvalues?  Functions working on otherwise illegal types?  Require a compilermode that catches non-Common stuff?  Should we document certain specificfunctions (e.g. COMPILE) as allowing implementation-specific keywordextensions. (cf IF-BODY discussion)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Chapter 23:Pathnames and the file system interface require much clarification andprobably some changes.  A comprehensive proposal is needed here.The Symbolics solution might work for us.  If we can't fix this up, weshould consider dumping the whole thing and going with something verysimple and minimal, such as a raw string in system-specific format todesignate a file.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 145:Specify that the &REST or &BODY argument to a macro may be the very listfrom the macro call, and not a copy, and therefore the user should notperform destructive operations on it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 60:Decide whether an &rest arg is required to be a freshly-consed list orwhether it may be part of a pre-existing list passed in by APPLY.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 162:Decide what the behavior of (THE (VALUES ...) form) should be.  Does itspecify exactly how many values should be returned, or a lower limit, orwhat?One proposal: in (THE (VALUES ...) form), the form may return morevalues, but not fewer, than the number of types specified in the (VALUES...) form, and any extra values are of unrestricted type.Also specify that (THE type form) where type is not (VALUES ...) isequivalent to (THE (VALUES type) form).[Discussed June/July 1986.]===========================================================================SIMPLE CHANGES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 239:Change CHAR-EQUAL, CHAR-NOT-EQUAL, CHAR-LESSP, CHAR-GREATERP,CHAR-NOT-LESSP, and CHAR-NOT-GREATERP to consider two characters to bedifferent if their bits attributes are different.[May be subsumed under a wholesale redesign of character objects,eliminating the BIT and FONT attributes.

NIL is confusing, and some implementationsuse symbols for certain streams.

They alreadymust be distinguishable from plain old vectors.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Forbid implementations to produce unsolicited output to*standard-ouput*.  Output to *error-ouput* is always OK.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 444:In the description of Decoded Time format, the Time-zone component isrequired to be an integer which is the number of hours west of GMT.(The latest term is Coordinated Universal Time, or UTC, by the way).Since time zones are not always an integral number of hours west of GMT,this should be changed to either (a) a non-complex, non-negative numberwhich is the number of hours west of GMT, or (b) an integer which is thenumber of {minutes, seconds} west of GMT.===========================================================================COMPLEX CHANGES:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 210:Change the branch cuts of the ATAN function to follow W.

I nowbelieve that we blew it here, and should consider un-blowing it.  Thechange will break some code, but the community might accept it anyway.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 26, 42:Alter the LIST type-specifier to distinguish proper lists from others andto specify the element-type of the list.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 93:Flush MACROLET, thereby doing away with environment arguments and relatedconfusion.[This has been proposed N times and rejected each time on the grounds thatMACROLET is not *totally* useless, but I still think that this is the rightthing to do. -- SEF]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 154:Eliminate the provision that a macro at the start of a body may expandinto a declaration.[KMP, who was one of the more vocal proponents of this feature, hasnow suggested that we consider flushing it.  It requires some confusingenvironment hackery to do this right.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 322:Flush *applyhook* and *evalhook* and related hackery.  Does anyone usethis (correctly) for anything other than implementing steppers?  If not,it may be preferable to forget about portable stepper hooks and makestepping an implementaiton-dependent facility like DEBUG.  These hookscause an awful lot of confusion and anxiety for users and implementors.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 153:Proposed alterations to SPECIAL declaration and possible addition ofUNSPECIAL (see Common Lisp mail around July 1986 including proposal byPavel).  One or more coherent proposals have to be constructed forconsideration.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 58:Turn the warning that standard macros should not expand intonon-standard special forms into a requirement.  Makes life easier forcode-walkers.[Can all implemenations live with this?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Three related, controversial proposals on case-sensitivity for symbols. 1)  Add a switch that would tell read and friends to suppress caseconversion, along with a note indicating that portable code assumes thisswitch to be OFF.  [SEF: This is the proposal dear to the unix people.  I still think thatit is asking for trouble to put this in.  Some code will assume thisswitch despite the warning, some won't, and the two kinds of code willnot mix.]2) Alternatively, think again about making the language case-preserving,but with INTERN ignoring case completely.  This means that there is *NO*way to create two symbols, one named "FOO" and the other named "foo",but now that we have strings this may not be necessary.[SEF: I now believe that this is what we should have done, but it isprobably too radical a change to consider at this point.]3) Add a property of read tables which tell whether READ under the read table preserves case.  READ-CHAR is not affected.[LMM: This is the way Xerox Lisp handles it, and it works very well. It puts case sensitivity where it belongs, as part of the read-table description.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 171:Even if we keep the status quo for symbols, we may want to reconsiderthe rules on case-sensitivity for package names.  Need a specificproposal and analysis of transition strategy.[LMM: this is unnecessary, I think.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 382:How to communicate the current depth in printing when there areuser-defined print functions?  Guy said that what had in mind was thatthe user would bind *print-level* according to the depth arg supplied tothe print function, but there were several problems with this.  Most ofthe tasteful solutions involved adding new args to WRITE which indicatedthe nature of the recursive use of the printer.  Others objected thatnobody wants to use WRITE directly, so that isn't a real fix.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Chapter 13:[Not in cleanup committee....]We need a comprehensive proposal for handling extended characters(16-bit char-code, plus possibly other fields) and strings of extendedcharacters.  The Japanese are developing a Kanji standard.  Maybe wecan just adopt this; certainly we must coordinate with it.At the same time, consider whether to retain the char-bit and char-fontfileds in present form.  Since an implementaiton may omit these fields,this should not break truly portable code.===========================================================================PROPOSED ADDITIONS:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???Add a new function TYPE-SPECIFIER-P that is true of valid typespecifiers and false of all other Lisp objects.  Note that the use ofDEFSTRUCT and DEFTYPE can change the behavior of TYPE-SPECIFIER-P overtime. (Discussed by not good results).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 226:Add SIGNED-LDB.  Like LDB but sign-extends the extracted byte.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 283:Add functions HASH-TABLE-REHASH-SIZE, HASH-TABLE-REHASH-THRESHOLD,HASH-TABLE-SIZE, and HASH-TABLE-TEST each take a hash table and returnthe appropriate current information.[ Which, if any, are SETF-able?  What does hash-table-test return, thefunction object for the test function? ]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 439:Add COMPILEDP.  This takes a function and returns non-NIL if it is acompiled function, and NIL if it is not.  If the function is a symbolwhose compiled-function definition was installed by the COMPILEfunction, then the non-NIL value returned is the interpreted definitionthat was compiled.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 439: Add UNCOMPILE.  This takes a symbol and restores the previousinterpreted definition of that symbol if that symbol previously had aninterpreted definition and was then given to COMPILE; otherwise noaction is taken.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 447:Add USER-NAME.  This returns a string identifying the user of the CommonLisp system, or NIL if that cannot be determined.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 327:Add *DISCARD-OUTPUT-STREAM* (alias, the bit bucket).[Make this a constant so that it can be optimized?  You should never wantto rebind this to another value.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 117:Add (CASE-WITH-TEST test item ...clauses...).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 51:Extension: Let COERCE coerce symbols to strings.  NIL is treated as theempty sequence, not a symbol.  Also let COERCE turn string-chars intostrings of length 1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Add TRUE and FALSE, functions that take any number of args, ignore them,and return T and NIL respectively.Someplace:---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 95, 267:Add SETF of NTHCDR.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 158:Add a TYPE-RESTRICT declaration.  (TYPE-RESTRICT type1 type2), wheretype2 is a subtype of type1, says that within the scope of thedeclaration if the compiler can prove a value is of type1, it isallowed to assume that it is of type2.  This gets rid of a lot ofmultiple-THE forms when you want maximally tense code.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 73:Fill out the set of mumble-P type predicates.  Currently we have someand not others.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:We need a set of "undoing" functions, so that interactive errors andfailed experiments can be recovered from without starting over.See comprehensive proposal by Eric Benson.[SEF: A generic "undo" facility, like SETF, has been opposed on variousoccasions, but is a bad idea because users will expect too much of it,and complain when it doesn't undo everything.][cf DEFINITION-FUNCTIONS, in prep]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 336:Add (syntax-type <character>), which returns one of the following::illegal, :whitespace, :constituent, :single-escape, :multiple-escape,:terminating-macro, :non-terminating-macro.[Make this setf-able?  If so, what do we do about macro characters thathave no definitions?]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 283:Add EQUALP hash-tables?  Case-insensitive hash-tables for strings?  Letthe user provide his own test (with associated hashing function)?  [Needa coherent proposal.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Have a function COPY that can copy any single object.  For a CONS cellit would copy just that CONS.  Whether (EQ X (COPY X)) for X a characteror number is implementation-dependent.[Proposal in archives by Morrison, needs some tuning.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 171:We need a way to say "use all the symbols from package FOO except for X,Y, ..."  Shadowing is no good, since you might want to inherit X fromsomewhere else.  Also, do we want a make-package that says ALL symbolsget exported?---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Fahlman's proposal for &more arguments, similar to &rest but leaves thearguments on the stack LEXPR-style.  Removes one of the worst inherentefficiency problems in Common Lisp.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 438:Review and develop a general philosophy on the handling of semi-standardsystem interface functions such as GC, BYE, ED, SAVE-SYSTEM, etc.  Thensee what we want to add (or remove).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Consider FUNCTION-PARAMETERS and related proposals that were discussedextensively in June/July 1986.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page ???:Consider PARSE-BODY and extended syntax for &BODY, as discussed inJune/July 1986.[Note, if we flush MACROLET or eliminate macro-expansion intodeclarations, this extension becomes less critical, though it may stillbe useful.]---------------------------------------------------------------------------Page 154:Permit declarations before the body of a LABELS, FLET, or MACROLET.===========================================================================For the compiler committee:---------------------------------------------------------------------------A lot of compiler/eval-when issues need to be settled.  Among theissues: Define clearly how REQUIRE interacts with the compiler.  AreDEFSETF-generated available in the compiler environment by default?---------------------------------------------------------------------------Package interactions with COMPILE and LOAD need to be worked out better.Restrict IN-PACKAGE, IMPORT, and firends to the start of files only?Add a new declarative form to handle this?  Some favor legitimzing -*-forms, but this is unacceptable to many.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Related issue: Add INCLUDE, or some other way to stuff multiple sourcefiles into one binary?  (Package hackery makes this complicated.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------Related issue: There should be some discussion of the semantics ofcompilation on literal constants (things appearing in quoted structurein code).  To what degree is sharing and non-sharing preserved?  Manyimplementations both introduce and remove sharing.  Probably most don'tdump circular structures.---------------------------------------------------------------------------What things can a compiler optimize by inline expansion, tail-recursionelimination, etc.?  What things must be handled correctly if the userredefines a built-in function (or specializes it using the objectfacility)?Proto-proposal: All built-in functions may be optimized inline(and therefore do not respond to later modifcation) unless this isinhibited with a NOTINLINE declaration.  Maybe create a list offunctions such as PRINT that are not open-coded by default.  Also,within a DEFUN, a recursive call to the function being defined may beoptimizied into a jump, unless this is inhibited by NOTINLINE.  (Maybethink up a better term than NOTINLINE.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------NEW:Declare *print-circle* means to print out shared structure too. Alternative: add another variable *print-shared*. Alternative: add another value to *print-circle* (nil :none   t :unspecified :circular :shared).       ? 1(DEFAULTFONT 1 (GACHA 10) (GACHA 8) (TERMINAL 8)) 

AIST (Agency of IndustrialScience and Technology), which is responsible for Japan Industrial Standards(JIS in short), has initiated its activity toward JIS Lisp standardization.In April 1986, in response to the request from AIST, a working group for Lispstandardization was formed at JEIDA (Japan Electronic Industry DevelopmentAssociation).  After one year's preliminary discussions, the followingcommittee "JEIDA Committee for Lisp Standardization" was formed and itsactive efforts have begun in June 1987.  The aim of this committee is todevelop a Lisp language specification suitable for JIS standard in cooperationwith ISO and the organizations for Lisp standardization in other countries.    JEIDA Committee for Lisp Standardization    ----------------------------------------    Chairman:        Takayasu Ito (Tohoku University)    Secretaries:        Tsuneo Furuyama (NTT: Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.)        Fumio Motoyoshi (ETL: Electrotechnical Laboratory)        Taiichi Yuasa (Kyoto University)    Members from Major Computer Companies:        Fujitsu Ltd.        Hitachi Ltd.        IBM Japan Ltd.        Mitsubishi Electric Corp.        NEC Corp.        Oki Electric Industry Co.

This group started technical discussions soon after it wasformed in August 1987.  It has been agreed that Common Lisp is a good startingpoint for technical discussions.

As with TG/A, X3J13 has agreed thatCommon Lisp is a good starting point for technical discussions.  We havealso been discussing various technical deficiencies of Common Lisp andproposals for their correction.The Lisp community as a whole can be best served if there are not toomany standards. We would like to invite a member TG/A to participate inthe  discussions of the "cleanup" working group of X3J13, and to bringforward those technical deficiencies that are of most serious concern toTG/A. Fortunately, almost all of our work goes on using electronic mail.We would welcome active participation, argumentation, proposals andcriticisms. ---   The "cleanup" committee*start*13849 00024 USfDate:  8 Oct 87 17:10 PDTFrom: Masinter.pato: masinterSubject: Statuscc: Masinterline-fold: noThis is a revised version of the status file I sent out 22-Sep-87.In some cases, I've indicated a question ???? on whether an item is ready to release.

Sinceprobably only half of the people on this list seem to reliably use anIn-Reply-To field in their message, the issue name is the only thingtying a conversation together into a single thread for filing purposes.In my view, the issue names should just be unique identifiers which areperhaps originally mnemonic, but whose most important aspect is thatthey let me reliably select a set of messages and know that if I've readall those messages, I am up to date in that conversation thread. Whenthe proposed function AREF-1D was renamed, for example, the issue namewas retained for the sake of those trying to track the conversation.The name change from TRACE-CLOS to TRACE-FUNCTION-ONLY left me with twofiles containing half a conversation each. It took a while for me to figure out what happened.If someone absolutely thinks that some issue name is so awful that it iskeeping them from getting work done on the issue and that only a namechange will solve the problem, I'd personally appreciate it if theycould make the renaming -very- prominent, mentioning both the old nameand the new name. eg, by a subject line like:  Subject: TRACE-FUNCTION-ONLY (formerly TRACE-CLOS)It would be helpful if Masinter's occassional issue summaries wouldmention the obsolete names, too, just for reference.Thanks.*start*10536 00024 USaReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 29 OCT 87 12:50:31 PSTReceived: from SCORE.STANFORD.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 29 Oct 87  12:12:47 PSTReceived: from hplabs.HP.COM (hplabs.hpl.hp.com.#Internet) by SCORE.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; Thu 29 Oct 87 12:08:43-PSTReceived: from hpfcla.HP.COM (hpfcla) by hplabs.HP.COM with SMTP ; Thu, 29 Oct 87 12:10:07 PSTReceived: from hpfclp.HP.COM by hpfcla.HP.COM; Thu, 29 Oct 87 12:58:33 mstReceived: from hpfcdcm.HP.COM by hpfclp.HP.COM; Thu, 29 Oct 87 12:57:42 mstReceived: from hpfcdcm by hpfcdcm.HP.COM; Thu, 29 Oct 87 12:57:30 mstReturn-Path: <dcm@hpfcdcm>To: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduCc: mathis@ada20.isi.edu, dcm%hpfcdcm@hplabs.HP.COMSubject: November X3J13 meetingFrom: Dave_Matthews%hpfclp@hplabs.HP.COMX-Mailer: mh6.5Date: Thu, 29 Oct 87 12:57:27 MSTMessage-Id: <5124.562535847@hpfcdcm>Sender: dcm%hpfclp@hplabs.HP.COMLast call for reservations and registrations.

Your skireservations, including lift tickets, can also be made through Lifecotravel when you make your travel reservations.There are some small board rooms available at the hotel if you would liketo use them Monday for committee meetings.  Please let me know what timesyou would like to reserve one so I can have one set aside for you.By the way, I seem to have typoed my phone number in the last mailing.

Mondayhas been set aside for committee meetings, followed by the main meeting onTuesday and Wednesday.  November is the perfect time to see fall (andsometimes winter) in Colorado.  Rocky Mountain National Park isapproximately one hour from Fort Collins.Hewlett-Packard's travel affiliate, Lifeco Travel, has negotiated discountairfares that you can obtain by calling:	800-521-8858 (in California)	800-722-8755 (elsewhere)Ask to make a group reservation for X3J13.  You may also make your room,rental car, or airport limousine reservations through Lifeco at the sametime.  Payment must be made by credit card.  Tickets will be mailed viaregistered mail.  Late reservations can be express mailed at additionalcost.A block of rooms is available at the University Park Holiday Inn at $46.50plus tax per night.  If you don't make reservations through Lifeco Travel,please make your own reservations by calling (303)482-2626 and asking toreserve a room in the "HP X3J13" block.  Reservations will be held until 6PM unless guaranteed by a major credit card.  Non-smoking rooms areavailable.  Check-in and check-out times are 1 PM.  The block of rooms willbe dropped on 11/2/87, but you should still be able to obtain thediscounted room rate on available rooms if you specify you are attendingthe the "HP X3J13" conference.Refreshments and lunch are being arranged for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Iexpect these arrangements will run $50 per person which I will collect atthe meeting.  Please note any dietary restrictions so I can make thenecessary arrangements with the catering department.If there is sufficient interest I would like to arrange a dinner Tuesdayevening at Cuisine, Cuisine.  Cuisine, Cuisine is an intimate cafe offeringsome the best and most unusual food in Northern Colorado.  It is a verysmall cafe which can only accommodate 60 total patrons, but they arewilling to put together a special banquet for us. To handle a group thislarge in a short period of time they would like to limit the menu to 4items.  The list of possible entrees includes: Cajun roast duckling withspice peach gravy, chicken boursin (double breast of chicken stuffed withherbed cream cheese dressing and mushroom voloute' sauce), shrimp diane(sauteed jumbo shrimp in a garlic cajun sauce), sirloin tips with mushroomsand onions, poached salmon with a special sauce, or boned leg of lambstuffed with spinach and served with a dijon sauce.  A vegetarian entreewill also be available.  Entrees would be about 15 dollars, including soupor salad.  Appetizers, dessert, and beverage would be ala carte.  Cuisine,Cuisine accepts charge cards, but cash would also be welcome.I would need to narrow this to the four items at least 2 weeks in advanceso they could make the necessary preparations.  Note if you are interestedon the registration form and mark your first and second choice entrees.Please note any dietary restrictions if this selection is not sufficient.Fort Collins is approximately a one hour drive from Denver's StapletonInternational Airport.  From the airport take I-270 or I-70 west to I-25and go north on I-25 towards Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Take the first FortCollins exit, #265, turn left and drive 5 miles to the College Avenueintersection.  Turn right and drive 3 miles to the Prospect Roadintersection.  Turn left and the Holiday Inn is just across the railroadtracks on the south side of the road.  It shouldn't be hard to see since itis 8 stories tall in an area with very few building over 2 stories.Two limousine services provide shuttle service from Stapleton directly tothe Holiday Inn.  Fort Collins Express (303-482-0505) leaves Stapleton onthe hour while the Front Range Airporter (303-221-5466) leaves Stapleton onthe half hour.  Both are located in the baggage claim area.  The charge is$12 each way on the Express and $13 on the Airporter.               |     Prospect Road                           ||                =========|======================                       ||           HI  |                                             ||            M              |                                             ||            O              |                                             ||            U              |                                             ||           N              |     Drake Road                 North        ||            T     =========|======================           /\          ||A              |                                 ||          ||            I              |US 287/ College Avenue                       ||           N              |                                             ||I-25       S              |                                             ||                           |     Horsetooth Road                         ||               =========|======================                       ||               |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |                                             ||                           |     Harmony Road                  HP       /||\       =========|=============================================||===========               |                                            \||/ Exit 265                 |                                             ||                                                                         ||                                                                         \/                                                                         Denver                                                                                                                                                                  Please return the following registration form by November 2 via electronicmail to dcm%hpfclp@hplabs.hp.com or via US Mail to:	Dave Matthews	Hewlett-Packard Company	3404 E Harmony Road	Fort Collins, Colorado  80525	(303)229-2201Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.__________________________________________________________________________	       X3J13 NOVEMBER MEETING REGISTRATION FORM                                           Name:			__________________________________________________Institution:		__________________________________________________Street Address:		__________________________________________________City, State, Zip:	__________________________________________________Phone:			__________________________________________________Network Address:	__________________________________________________Dinner	11/17 (y/n):	__________________________________________________	First choice:	__________________________________________________	Second choice:	__________________________________________________	(Duck, chicken, shrimp, sirloin, salmon, lamb, vegetarian)Dietary Restrictions:  	__________________________________________________                      		  	__________________________________________________		  	__________________________________________________*start*00936 00024 USfReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 02 NOV 87 12:44:45 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 2 Nov 87  12:41:31 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 02 NOV 87 12:40:48 PSTDate: 2 Nov 87 12:40 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: visit, Professor Takayasu ItoTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <871102-124048-1490@Xerox>Prof. Ito is the chairman of the JEIDA Committee for LispStandardization.

(I am working on the "cleanup" committee of the US ANSI standards group for Common Lisp.) He recently sent a message to Common-Lisp@Sail.stanford.edu (which includes this list) describing standards work in Japan.Our discussion concerned the relative directions of the JEIDA Lisp standard group and the US ANSI Lisp standard group.  I hope that we can work together to consider the various issues that have come up about problems and their solutions in Common Lisp. I think it would not help anyone in the world-wide Lisp community for there to be different standards for Lisp in different countries; the community is not big enough.He said that the JEIDA group had a list of 50 issues or problem areas. I hope he will send the list to the US Cleanup committee.I pointed out to him that Fuji Xerox had no representatives in the JEIDA working group on Common Lisp standards. He mentioned that only "major computer companies" were currently members, although there were observers from various universities.If you have any additional information about non-US Lisp standards work, I would be interested to hear of it.*start*08045 00024 UShReturn-Path: <mcvax!inria.inria.fr!chaillou@uunet.UU.NET>Received: from uunet.UU.NET by Xerox.COM ; 12 NOV 87 23:42:44 PSTReceived: from mcvax.UUCP by uunet.UU.NET (5.54/1.14) with UUCP 	id AA27365; Fri, 13 Nov 87 01:10:11 ESTReceived: by mcvax.cwi.nl; Fri, 13 Nov 87 05:33:57 +0100 (MET)Received: by inria.inria.fr; Thu, 12 Nov 87 23:10:06 +0100 (MET)Date: Thu, 12 Nov 87 23:10:06 +0100From: mcvax!inria.inria.fr!chaillou@uunet.UU.NET (Jerome Chailloux)Message-Id: <8711122210.AA11492@inria.inria.fr>To: fahlman@cmu-cs-c.edu, gls@think.com, masinter.PA, mathis@AJPO.SEI.CMU.EDU, mathis@c.ISI.EDU, tekchips!willc@uunet.UU.NET, rpg@sail.stanford.eduSubject: For spare time (hah) in Fort Collins...Sorry to get this in the mail to you so late... see you in Fort Collins.--------------------Dear Colleagues,This note is a continuation of the efforts made on both sides of theAtlantic to combine our efforts fruitfully in the area of Lispstandardisation.  Your overtures together with the recentdevelopments at ISO prompt us to assist the dialogue by clarifyingour ideas.  We hope this may be able to serve as a basis for informaldiscussion at the X3J13 meeting at Fort Collins.The recent formation of Working Group Sixteen at ISO provides all ofus with an official framework within which to continue our effortstoward an international Lisp standard.  However, as all of us haveseen, the formal procedures require a considerable level of consensuswhich is most practically reached with the usual kind of technicalinterchange.  In that context, we hope to clarify for you our ideas inthis note.Common Lisp represents a wealth of experience and effort which willimmensely benefit the development of an international Lisp standard.The ongoing activity at X3J13 indicates your interest in having CommonLisp evolve into an official standard. We will set out our ideas abouthow the efforts at ISO relate to those at X3J13.Our goal in working toward a Lisp standard is to provide a Lisp whichwill be useful in (in no particular order) industrial softwareproducts,  in research and in instruction in Computer Science.  Thatgoal dictates the following desiderata:1) a standard which allows and encourages efficient implementation ongeneral purpose hardware.  (the advances in non-dedicatedarchitectures discourage the use of the slightly pejorative term"conventional hardware")2) a validation procedure for implementations that will guarantee adegree of portability for Lisp equivalent to that expected in otherstandardized languages.3) a language structured such that the principles may be set forthsuccinctly and absorbed straightforwardly (although not necessarilyeasily!)These desiderata are consistent with the goals set out for CommonLisp in CLtL.  	However, how do we advance from these common goals ina concrete fashion?  For ISO Lisp to benefit significantly fromCommon Lisp it is important to share the general framework withinwhich that effort took place.  This means that no single issue (forinstance, the debate at both X3J13 and the EuLisp committeesurrounding a unified value/function cell) should unduly impede theISO process.We have however, two general concerns which must be allayed that wemay make use of the framework of Common Lisp.First of all, the demands for run-time processing (dynamic decisionmaking), made of interpreter, compiler, incremental compiler orwhatever other implementation technique, should be reduced.  This isconsistent with desiderata one above about general purpose hardware.Run-time processing is more easily made invisible on micro-codedmachines but often introduces arcana on a general purpose machine,coupled with a cost which is amortized over the whole computation.Two examples are "explicit dynamic binding" and "absence of typespecific versions" in section II and III below.Our second concern is that for proposal at ISO Lisp, portions ofCommon Lisp will need to be better specified to guarantee the twingoals of validation of implementations as well as guaranteed behaviorof valid programs.As a basis for ISO Lisp, Common Lisp is split into 3 groups by theprevious concerns.  The first part comprises those portions of CommonLisp that we propose ISO Lisp should adopt without significantrevision.  That part represents the majority of Common Lisp andcorresponds to that part which describes the functionality of CommonLisp (which would be called libraries in other languages).  Thesecond part comprises aspects of Common Lisp for which we areexamining improvements or clarifications.  It is to the third partthat we are paying the most attention to ensure the satisfaction ofthe goals stated above about limiting run-time requirements andprovision for validation and security.We do not give a definitive categorization here, but outline the partsas follows:I) Acceptable without revision from Common Lisp:	(other than those proposed at X3J13 already):	Default lexical binding, and optional dynamic binding.	Naming Conventions (full English words separated by dashes).	The standard presence of NIL of any empty list type.	The majority of the syntax.	The following special forms		(block catch flet function go if		labels macrolet multiple-value-call		multiple-value-prog1 progn progv quote		return-from setq		tagbody throw unwind-protect)II) Topics requiring revision or further specification:Explicit dynamic binding:	We propose special forms dynamic-let and dynamic-let*.	This would remove the only obligatory declaration (special)	which is something of an anomaly amongst the rest of the	declarations: it specifies behavior of the name not the type	of the value.  (This would also help		clarify the moment of macro expansion, since the first	macros in a form wouldn't be expanded at a different	time while hunting for declarations.)Formal semantics for the special forms and evaluation process:	While a formal semantics for all of ISO Lisp would be of	dubious utility, a formal description of the action of the	special forms and evaluation process would help specify	their interaction.  Clarification of environment and moment:	Macroexpand and eval-when lack sufficient description	of their environment.		The phases considered by eval-when  need to be fully specified	describe in the case of an interpreter, incremental compiler, 	and file compilation.  The semantics of top-level require further 	specification (do intervening progns still constitute	top-level?  What else?).III) Major questions:Types:	Some of these questions have already been identified by the		cleanup committee.	A distinct type 'function' is necessary (to sort out the problems		vis a` vis apply).	The type hierarchy needs to be uniformly extensible		(e.g. in CL one cannot extend number or sequence).	The subtype predicate needs an exact definition.	The relationship between the type system and the object system		needs to be spelled out exactly.	Access to primitives must be assured (e.g. for fixnum arithmetic,		direct functional access, or mandatory treatment of		declarations)Packages:It is important that the mechanisms of the name space management beclear enough for users to predict behavior of the system.  Inaddition, a facility for symbols that are accessible by default at thetop-level regardless of the current package is convenient.modules:Modules (as the term in used in other programming languages, referringto freezing the behavior and access to code and data) are necessary toguarantee the correct behavior of valid programs.Of course, just by listing the topics this way, we haven't provideddetailed justification for our concerns nor full explanations of thekind of solutions on which we are working.  However, we hope thatproviding our view of the concerns for ISO Lisp can encourage concreteco-operation on the development of ISO Lisp.Yours,Jerome ChaillouxGreg NuyensJulian PadgetChristian Queinnec*start*00790 00024 USaReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 12 NOV 87 15:22:06 PSTReceived: from SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 12 Nov 87  15:20:39 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 278443; Thu 12-Nov-87 18:20:28 ESTDate: Thu, 12 Nov 87 18:19 ESTFrom: David A.

I'd like to see Moon draft a proposal that addresses these issues explicitly.SEQUENCE-FUNCTIONS-EXCLUDE-ARRAYS (version 4) I can't support the GENERALIZE proposal; I want to return to the MODIFIED proposal.  My reasons are not those described in the summary as the "majority reason for opposition." Rather, I am worried about the fact that, as Touretzky himself pointed out, this proposal is aimed at de-emphasizing the importance of the container shape. I think the  Lisp language has traditionally placed great importance on structural shape and I am not happy to toss all that aside. I am happy to define COERCE to allow coercion of matrices to vectors because that allows the programmer to express explicit intent. I am also happy to allow implicit coercion on operations that abstractly make sense without having to think about shape changing. For now, though, that's as far as I'm willing to go.SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO (version 3) I recognize this as an important concern and generally approve of making a proposal along these lines, but there are a lot of particulars that I am not sure about. If this goes to a vote now, it should mark me as believing that it is premature. Among the issues I'd like more time to think about are the choice of SETF as the symbol in the car of the name list, the ability to supply a non-symbol to SYMBOL-FUNCTION, the syntax implications for TRACE (since some implementations already define a meaning for lists occurring in TRACE's argument positions).TRACE-FUNCTION-ONLY (version 5) Probably something along these lines is appropriate, but I would like to see this tabled pending action on the SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO issue and on the CLOS spec. Further, I think it would be better to do a more general review of what functionality TRACE might want to provide. We risk getting ourselves in a situation where (TRACE ... list ...) is overloaded in such a way that (TRACE (METHOD ...)) might mean either to trace a function called METHOD or to trace a method. Although this could be resolved using heuristics, it would be bad for us to muck up the syntax so badly that we had to resort to heuristics to dig ourselves out.*start*14394 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 15 NOV 87 13:28:47 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 15 Nov 87  03:06:10 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 14 NOV 87 23:04:11 PSTDate: 14 Nov 87 23:03 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Issue statusTo: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EduMessage-ID: <871114-230411-3596@Xerox>I'm not sure this is entirely up to date-- I don't think I've updatedthe version number and date on a couple of proposals.

Certainly the parts I have controlover will be well on their way to being done in a year. Issues that dependon the committee's creation or approval are another matter. Also, thingslike time to publish and X3 review time are unknown at this time. So myconfidence is qualified. Additionally, I feel that a lot of the burdenactually rests on the editorial committee, especially you and Kent. (I addedyour name to the list and returned that new list to Bob Mathis.)You are both vocal and you have credibility. If you believe the standardsays what it is supposed to say, you will be able to convince the restof the gang.Putting it another way: If you're confident, so am I.Another problem is that Guy has not responded with the sources for theCLtL or anything, actually. He's not at his phone, and has not answeredhis mail. This could slow me up in a big way later on, so now I'm spendingtime trying to get around his roadblock. Any suggestions?>As for getting Xerox reference material, send me a physical mail address and>I'll see if I can get a copy shipped to you.

To conform to the standard, implementations are required either to document what these forms do, or to document their absense. No portable Common Lisp program should rely on the presense of these features.I thought Lucid was going to supply their text instead of CLtL. If they do, that's just as well.

After correspondingwith you, GLS, and RPG, the decision was unanimous that Lucid should beused. Then I checked with KMP, as I had remembered that he had very strongfeelings about using the CLtL. As predicted, he does not favor in the leastusing Lucid documentation, and of course has very good reasons for his stand.I am writing to you not for an answer, but because I think you can give mesome guidance. I know there will be many issues on which there is not 100%agreement, and I haven't been around long enough to know what you have done in this case, on the clean-up committee, for example. It seems that any major decisions have been made with KMP's concurrence. I have 3 obvious choices (ignore KMP, ignore GLS/RPG/you, come up with a compromise position and convince everyone of its goodness). There are surelyother ways to approach this, and I would like to take the best of thesolutions and set a precedent for decision-making at this point, so thatprogress will be inevitable.Are you the right person to be burdened with this question? If not, pleaseredirect me to someone who may be more appropriate.Thanks for your help!kc*start*02330 00024 USaReturn-Path: <chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.com>Received: from decwrl.dec.com by Xerox.COM ; 15 DEC 87 10:08:39 PSTReceived: by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.4/4.7.34)	id AA02376; Tue, 15 Dec 87 10:09:44 PSTDate: Tue, 15 Dec 87 10:09:44 PSTMessage-Id: <8712151809.AA02376@decwrl.dec.com>From: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comTo: Masinter.pa, CHAPMAN@decwrl.dec.comSubject: RE: Re: question about base document>One compromise position you should consider is to start with both: you, as>editor, will read take the text from CLtL and Lucid for each individual item,>and use whatever wording you think is most precise.

My job is to make sure this processof coming to a decision from a compromise position doesn't take an infiniteamount of time. I have been doing some research on other ANSI committees andjust found out some interesting things about the Ada committee. Apparentlytheir situation wasn't analogous to ours in a very fundamental way - theyhad a `dictator' decide all issues based on recommendations from a knowlegeableset of people.

Even with compromise positions with valid and extensive reasoning behind them all, there is the chance that all individuals willhang on to their current beliefs. In this case a little history would helpme decide how much to worry about this. Can you help me here?kc         ========================================================================Received: from XEROX.COM by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.4/4.7.34)	id AA02294; Tue, 15 Dec 87 09:51:14 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 15 DEC 87 09:49:04 PSTIn-Reply-To: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.com's message of Tue, 15 Dec 87 08:11:17 PSTMessage-Id: <871215-094904-1400@Xerox>*start*04706 00024 UShReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 17 DEC 87 17:39:27 PSTReceived: from SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 17 Dec 87  17:35:48 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 306483; Thu 17-Dec-87 20:35:35 ESTDate: Thu, 17 Dec 87 20:35 ESTFrom: David A.

For most of the issuesraised, I have no comment.  Feel free to forward these commentsback to our Japanese friends if desired.    1) CLtL says nothing about whether structure or array is self evaluating       form. [5.1.1]       It is suggested that not only numbers, characters, and bit-vectors,       but also structures, arrays, vectors, packages be self-evaluating forms.       Yuasa:  There may possibly be some reason that these objects are not	       allowed to be evaluated.  But the reason is not known.       This simplification is convenient both for the user and for the implementor.       Note that some implementations such as Exper Common Lisp signal an error       when those objects that CLtL does not explicitly say are self-evaluating       are being evaluated.      <<The Rationale for this could easily be provided in the standard.	Does this need an Issue? >>It's not true that CLtL says nothing about this; the bottom of page 54in the English edition says evaluating any other object is an error.I don't know what the rationale was; unless somebody knows, we can't easilyprovide it in the standard!At Symbolics we pondered this for a while and settled on the idea thatonly objects of type (OR CONS SYMBOL) do anything special when evaluated,and all other objects evaluate to themselves.  We haven't had any problemsas a result of this.CLtL says something about implementation-dependent extensions forevaluating other types of objects, but we decided that this didn't makesense for any of the object types defined by CLtL.  An implementationcould certainly invent a new, non-COMMON object type with a new way ofevaluating it, and then that (OR CONS SYMBOL) would be extended to (ORCONS SYMBOL other-type) in that implementation.  But since a portableprogram presumably wouldn't use any objects of thatimplementation-dependent type, this should't interfere with portabilityeven if we define that all objects of types defined by CLtL, other thanCONS and SYMBOL, are self-quoting.Evidently current practice varies between implementations.  This needs anissue if we want to change it, but since "is an error" allows completeimplementation-dependent freedom, we don't have to say anything if wethink the status quo is okay.    1) If read-base is 16, `1E0' is read as an integer and not a float. [2.1.3]	<< I think this is a wording change rather than an Issue.>>I don't think this is a problem at all, since 22.1.2 (page 343) is veryexplicit about this.    5) Same keyword parameter can appear more than once in an actual argument        list. [5.2.2]       This is necessary to overwrite passed keyword arguments.       << New issue KEYWORD-ARGUMENT-DUPLICATES? >>Not an issue, 5.2.2 (page 62 in the English edition) is already veryexplicit about this "If more than one such argument pair matches,it is not an error; the leftmost argument pair is used."    4) ---    Q: Is there any way to escape from Lisp context.    A: Some systems, such as Lisp machine have no concept of escaping.    This is needed for Lisp systems under stock operating systems.    It is necessary to determine the name even if the function    may be implementation dependent.    Recommendation: (QUIT) will be a proper word for this operation.    << Seems like it goes in the environment section. >>I remember this was discussed at length a couple years ago, and theconclusion was that the semantics of quitting varied so much betweenimplementations that there was no point in trying to standardizeanything.  Even without thinking about multiprocess systems, nor aboutLisp machines, you have to ask whether after quitting the Lisp vanishesor can be restarted, whether a command string can be returned to theoperating system, whether a success/failure code is required to bereturned to the operating system, etc.  Finally it is unclear how aportable program could usefully benefit from this.*start*02786 00024 UShReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 17 DEC 87 18:15:58 PSTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 17 Dec 87  18:12:45 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU.#Internet>; Thu 17 Dec 87 21:12:34-ESTDate: Thu, 17 Dec 87 21:12 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12359327290.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

Moon <Moon at STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>    It's not true that CLtL says nothing about this; the bottom of page 54    in the English edition says evaluating any other object is an error.    I don't know what the rationale was; unless somebody knows, we can't easily    provide it in the standard!    At Symbolics we pondered this for a while and settled on the idea that    only objects of type (OR CONS SYMBOL) do anything special when evaluated,    and all other objects evaluate to themselves.  We haven't had any problems    as a result of this.I remember some of the discussions on this issue (though I no longerremember which side I was on -- scary!).  A number of people wanted to make allobjects other than Conses and Symbols be self-evaluating; a number ofother people didn't want to close off the space of possible extensionsin this way.  The latter group won.In retrospect, it seems clear that this was a mistake -- nobody has usedthe added freedom as far as I know, and the need to quote such things asvectors has definitely led to confusion among new users and anoccasional spurious bug report.  I'd support a move to change this, sothat we could all assume self-evaluating objects when we're writingportable code.  Since "it is an error" to eval objects of miscellaneoustypes, implementations are legally free to adopt the self-evalconvention, but I would argue that it is a bit treacherous for theirusers if they do, since the local users will be in for a nasty surprisewhenever they move to a system that doesn't use this convetion.On the Quit issue, I think that Masinter has suggested the right way tohandle this: ed, dribble, and friends should be suggested names forcertain environment-related operations, but nothing more.  The standardwould explicitly say that these environment functions may or may notexist in any given implementation, and that what they do will vary fromone environment to another.  CLtL currently says a bit too much aboutsome of these things, which causes people to want to say even more.-- Scott*start*03114 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 31 DEC 87 17:25:18 PSTReceived: from SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 31 Dec 87  17:23:01 PSTReceived: from RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 313392; Thu 31-Dec-87 20:22:54 ESTDate: Thu, 31 Dec 87 20:22 ESTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Releasing potentially confusing info to the CL communityTo: masinter.PARCcc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUIn-Reply-To: <871231-163511-2608@Xerox>Message-ID: <871231202220.9.KMP@RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>[Common-Lisp removed; CL-Cleanup added.]    Date: 31 Dec 87 16:34:23 PST (Thursday)    From: masinter.PARC@Xerox.COM    To: COMMON-LISP@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU    There will probably be a letter ballot to X3J13 to confirm the cleanup items    accepted by voice vote at the recent X3J13 meetings.

If peoplestart randomizing some but not all dialects in a disorganized fashion to try totake "cleanup" changes into effect, there will be even more chaos than there isalready. Some changes are not compatible. The others are only compatible if youassume that all implementations are changed in lockstep; if some implementationschange and others do not, then porting code from changed implementations tonon-changed implementations may be expensive. Our current environmental impactstatements do not discuss this I-think-peculiar-and-undesirable situation.I very very strongly believe that the chunking size of any information to the CLcommunity should be considerably larger (ie, something like a "draft proposed standard")than these proposals -- never something trivially separable like this. Otherwiseyou get into a non-linear situation where one CL implementation has informally madechanges A, B, and C and others have made changes C, D, and E and you can't comparethem. On the other hand, it is easy to compare CLtL to draft CL-88 or perhaps-not-draftCL-90 because the changes will be sufficiently bundled that we can afford to givethem a name. I'm loathe to think that CL's will be identified by non-linear nameslike CLtL+FLET-fix+...Either that or it might work to number the decisions and say that if you implementany cleanups, you must implement all the cleanups which precede it so that a singlerevision number may be assigned to your implementation. I'd have to think more aboutthis if anyone wanted to pursue it.-kmp*start*01810 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 31 DEC 87 17:51:55 PSTReceived: from XEROX.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 31 Dec 87  17:49:30 PSTReceived: from Burger.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 31 DEC 87 17:48:25 PSTSender: "Larry Masinter".PARCDate: 31 Dec 87 17:47:39 PST (Thursday)Subject: Re: Releasing potentially confusing info to the CL communityFrom: masinter.PARCTo: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMcc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUIn-Reply-to: KMP%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics:COM's message of 31 Dec 87 17:23:13 PST (Thursday)Message-ID: <871231-174825-2644@Xerox>Sigh.

I think that we can dissimenate information that X3J13 has"endorsed" some changes in a letter ballot, and once the changes have beenendorsed, implementors are encouraged to go ahead and adopt those changes anddocument them. I hear your concern to be that we want to reduce the amount of chaos in the CLworld, and encourage compatibility.  If so, I agree whole-heartedly. The issuethen comes down to whether releasing X3J13-adopted resolutions is likely toincrease or decrease people's understanding of where ambiguities in CLtL mightlie and what they can watch out for. I think the mere existance of the issue andthe Discussion in fact are very informative for most users, and will help themunderstand areas that they have to watch out for.

I would say something more like: The information contained in these proposals is provided for informational purposes only and is not a suggestion that implementors should implement the changes mentioned. In fact, implementors are strongly encouraged not to implement any changes which are incompatible with CLtL, since the principle value of CLtL as a standard is that it has no competitors. If implementors pick and choose from CLtL and whichever of these modifications they find easy or interesting, the state of informal standardization in the Common Lisp community will be lessened. Extensions mentioned in these writeups which are compatible extensions can, of course, be added at any time but should not be described as Common Lisp. Until an ANSI or ISO Common Lisp standard is available, the name Common Lisp should refer only to what is in CLtL for the sake of everyone's sanity. These extensions may be referred to as "proposed extensions" which might someday be part of a future Common Lisp standard.    The cleanup proposals, in their various draft forms, are a good indication of    those places where CLtL is ambiguous, lacking, or subject to change; those    cleanup proposals endorsed by X3J13 are a very good indication of what the ANSI    standard will look like. However, the result of the standard process will be a    single standard with (we hope) no options.

I think that it is unreasonable to tell implementors to stickwith CLtL and to ignore all the individual proposals that have beenadopted until ANSI and ISO formally adopt a new standard for all ofCommon Lisp.  Maybe that has to be our legal position so that thiscommittee doesn't get sued, but in a rational world (meaning one inwhich all the lawyers and those who traffic with them have been killedoff), it would make sense for implementors to track these changes asthey are adopted, or perhaps in discrete batches.  I grant that it iswrong to pick and choose among these issues; in a given release youshould adopt all of them up to some particular cutoff date, and shouldclearly state what you have done.Most of these items, after all, resolve some ambiguity in CLtL.  Toignore them is to perpetuate a situation where no standardizationcurrently exists.  Some others (the error system and CLOS, but also somesmaller ones) address omissions from CLtL that people are dealing within various incompatible ways.  In very few cases are we proposing atruly incompatible change, and where we do it is usually in some casewhere the existing situation is unworkable or is incompatible with someof the above-mentioned extensions.  In each case, we have addressed theissue of how existing code can be updated to fit into the new system.Obviously it creates some portability problems if implementations trackthese changes with different delays, but I think that the situation wewould get if we advised people to wait a few years until this is donewould be much worse in practice.  I'm not sure what the current officialstatement is on when we might expect an official standard or even anapproved draft standard from X3J13, but we can't really expect people tostand pat until the great day arrives.-- Scott*start*01717 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 04 JAN 88 08:55:20 PSTReceived: from A.ISI.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 4 Jan 88  08:52:25 PSTDate: 4 Jan 88 11:50 ESTSender: MATHIS@A.ISI.EDUSubject: Re: cleanup statusFrom: MATHIS@A.ISI.EDUTo: KMP@SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPACc: cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <[A.ISI.EDU] 4-Jan-88 11:50:38.MATHIS>In-Reply-To: <880103211335.8.KMP@RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>I usually keep quiet on this list, but I think the proposedmessage of Larry's with Kent's modifications is coming prettyclose to something we should distribute to the whole community.I get requests for X3J13 documents and send them out with someform of disclaimer - this is only a working draft of somethingunder consideration.

Second, most of your examples of how this is useful are in areas that seem to be "environment" rather than "language", and there's some sentiment to reduce the area where the standard dictates environment features and focus on programming language semantics.Finally, there's some strong sentiment that the package system is not the best way to achieve what it was designed to do, and that some replacement for information hiding and name-spaces ought to be found. In the interim, adding more constraints and features to the package system would make transition to something new more painful.*start*01412 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 06 JAN 88 13:36:48 PSTReceived: from LABREA.STANFORD.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 6 Jan 88  13:34:21 PSTReceived: by labrea.stanford.edu; Wed, 6 Jan 88 13:34:23 PSTReceived: from bhopal.lucid.com by edsel id AA20541g; Wed, 6 Jan 88 12:48:49 PSTReceived: by bhopal id AA11867g; Wed, 6 Jan 88 12:51:10 PSTDate: Wed, 6 Jan 88 12:51:10 PSTFrom: Jon L White <edsel!jonl@labrea.stanford.edu>Message-Id: <8801062051.AA11867@bhopal.lucid.com>To: labrea!MATHIS%A.ISI.EDU@labrea.stanford.eduCc: labrea!cl-cleanup%SAIL@labrea.stanford.eduIn-Reply-To: MATHIS@A.ISI.EDU's message of 4 Jan 1988 11:50-EST <[A.ISI.EDU] 4-Jan-88 11:50:38.MATHIS>Subject: cleanup statusre:     People who want to be involved with the discussions and decision    making should be working within X3J13; but we also have a    responsibility for providing authoritative information on what we    are doing and what implications it may have for current and    future implementations of the "standard."This seems to me a succinct, reasonable statement of policy regarding"outsiders".

There's probably no need for us to lecture the vendors    on how closely the must adhere to CLtL -- it's their responsibility to    document their deviations and extensions.I'm sorry, but I disagree. I do not believe that we with our vendors'hats on do have the wisdom or the freedom from conflict of interest tomake that decision correctly.When there was only CLtL, it was obvious what was the right thing andwhat was not. It is no longer obvious because our committee is randomizingthings. Our committee must speak clearly to the community about what weintend so that people who want to adhere to that advice can do so.It is in vendors' best interest to add as many whizzy features as theycan because it makes for more bullet items on marketing literature, becausebug fixes sound (naively) like an improvement over non-bug fixes, and becausethe more you can make your implementation different than CL, the more lockedinto your product your customer base becomes.On the other hand, I believe it is in the community's best interest forthere to be a clear source of authority. For better or worse, a standardexists with certain features people can depend upon. If people gochanging things around at random, application vendors get screwed tryingto keep up with the different rates of change on the different platforms.I'm speaking from experience as a Macsyma maintainer (large 3rd party product)not from my current position as a lisp developer.In Cloe, the LISP package does exactly what the LISP package in CLtL saysit should. If we wanted to extend anything, we did it on a proprietary packagethat shadowed the LISP symbol. For example, CLOE:IF takes a body but LISP:IFis true to the standard. CLOE:CHAR-EQUAL fixes the CHAR-EQUAL mess, butLISP:CHAR-EQUAL does what CLtL losingly says it should. I think this is theright approach for all vendors to take until a standard is reached.If we don't say this to the community, who can?If chaos results, who is to blame but us?*start*00929 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 06 JAN 88 18:06:45 PSTReceived: from C.CS.CMU.EDU by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 6 Jan 88  18:04:23 PSTReceived: ID <FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDU.#Internet>; Wed 6 Jan 88 21:04:28-ESTDate: Wed, 6 Jan 88 21:04 ESTMessage-ID: <FAHLMAN.12364568696.BABYL@C.CS.CMU.EDU>Sender: FAHLMAN@C.CS.CMU.EDUFrom: "Scott E.

An implementation will either conformor it will not. If implementors want our advice (unlikely as that might be), we'd advise them toquickly adopt those proposals which resolve ambiguities in CLtL and (as"Proposed Extensions likely to be in the Common Lisp standard") to implementthose proposals that are extensions.However, we would advise implementors not to release (at least as "Common Lisp")implementations with the proposals that are incompatible changes; to dootherwise would increase the diversity of "Common Lisp" implementations forusers, rather than decrease it. Most strongly, of course, we'd advise implementors to document theirimplementation carefully in these areas, so that users might at least #+ and #-around problem areas.Part of the reason is that, even though the proposals have received endorsementin isolation, they may be later superseded by other proposals or rescinded onthe basis of "new evidence".What's it all mean to users of Common Lisp?Well, of course, we hope the proposals themselves cntain useful information,and explain why there was an issue at all, and the reasons for our choice. If you have strong opinions about any of the proposals, make sure your X3J13representative hears about them. If you would like some additional changes,please give them to your X3J13 representative to submit.*start*01339 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 07 JAN 88 12:26:29 PSTReceived: from THINK.COM by SAIL.STANFORD.EDU with TCP; 7 Jan 88  12:24:00 PSTReturn-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from kali.think.com by Think.COM; Thu, 7 Jan 88 15:23:37 ESTReceived: by kali.think.com; Thu, 7 Jan 88 15:23:33 ESTDate: Thu, 7 Jan 88 15:23:33 ESTFrom: gls@Think.COMMessage-Id: <8801072023.AA02073@kali.think.com>To: Masinter.PARC, KMP@stony-brook.scrc.symbolics.com, CL-Cleanup@sail.stanford.eduIn-Reply-To: Kent M Pitman's message of Thu, 7 Jan 88 03:25 EST <880107032551.5.KMP@RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: your proposed revisionI think Larry has done a very good job on the latest draft.

However, this recommendation will probably wait until the resolution of the handling of extended language features (multiple character sets.) There is some disagreement on that topic. Tom Linden (BAGGINS@IBM.COM) is the chairman of the character subcommittee. There will be character subcommittee the same week as the March X3J13 meeting; perhaps it would be useful if you were to attend. I urge you to contact Tom Linden directly.On the issue of COERCE: in the cleanup subcommittee we discussed the following principle: Common Lisp contains many "implicit" coercions, e.g., it is legitimate to coerce from a string to a pathname. It would be useful for the COERCE function to implement explicitly all of the implicit coercions of common lisp.If you have a summary of a design for COERCE, the most useful way to present this would be for you to put it in the standard "cleanup" proposal form. If you could do this, the cleanup committee then could endorse it as a proposal to the larger X3J13.Here is the cleanup proposal form:  Format for proposals to the cleanup committee (Version 13)                    November 20, 1987Replace the text below in >> double inverted angle-brackets <<.

It describes some fundamental assumptions of our work inthis sub-committee, the process we use to consider changes, and a sampler ofsome of the changes we are considering.\section{Assumptions.}We believed the only reasonable way to obtain a standard for Lisp was to startwith a known, widely implemented description, namely ``Common Lisp theLanguage'' by Guy L. Steele Jr. ({\em CLtL}) and to consider individuallyvarious clarifications, changes, additions, enhancements, modifications.Common Lisp ``works''. It is widely implemented. Common Lisp has arelatively small kernel of semantics, facilities for extensions, and alarge library of data types and operations on them. It is a goodstarting point for a Lisp standard.  We do not believe that it isnecessary to start over to design a good Lisp standard.  Even if onefavors modifications to the fundamentals of the language semantics(e.g., function and variable name scoping), most of the library of datatypes and operations of Common Lisp will continue to form a good basisfor applications and it is valuable to clarify the operation of thelibrary.There are three kinds of problems with CLtL we would like to resolve increating a standard.First, CLtL had its roots in a user's level description of a programmingsystem; although it is wonderfully specific as user manuals go, thereare numerous places that allow more implementation flexibility than isdesirable in a standard.  In a standard, we would expect thatambiguities to be either eliminated or else {em explicitly} allowed.Secondly, CLtL was written and published without extensive prior use of some ofits features; a few have turned out to be unworkable or useless and notimplemented. We hope to change or remove those features.Third, we've discovered that there are features that exist in nearly in everyimplementation but with different names and calling conventions or (in a veryfew instances) are logical extensions of the current specification. We wouldlike to augment the standard by providing access from the standard language tothose features.\section {The process.}The cleanup subcommittee considers those minor changes that are not beingaddressed by any of the other single-topic subcommittees of X3J13 (objects,windows and graphics, characters, iteration, compilation, validation, and a fewothers.)We consider proposals both internally generated by members of the cleanupcommittee or are received from members of the community.Almost all work of the committee is handled via electronic mail. Werarely meet as a group in person. Most decisions are made by consensus.When we cannot agree by consensus whether to endorse a proposal, we maypresent it to X3J13 for voting with the various points of viewrepresented in the writeup; we believe our responsibility is to fullydescribe the issues, and allow the larger community to vote.We attempt to analyze the costs and benefits for each proposed modification.Each proposal, considered individually, must make the language better--enoughbetter to be worth the cost of making a change.  To this end, we require thateach proposal be accompanied by an analysis of the various costs and benefits.Of course, there are conflicts in the interpretation of costs and benefits.  There are some general principles of good programming language design:programs should be easy to read; programs should be easy to write; thelanguage should allow users to write efficient prgrams. These goalssometimes work against each other: for example, adding features makesthe job easier for the program writer, but harder for the reader. Theseconflicts in desired make the design process difficult, because it isnot possible to optimize all of the design goals simultaneously.The process of explicitly addressing costs and benefits has successfullyeliminated arguments based merely on personal preference. Most often, whatinitially seems like a matter of taste in fact has roots in a more explicitjudgment of benefit over cost. By adopting an explicit format for those items,we've managed to expose the underlying principles.We only consider ``complete'' proposals. While we've discussed some openproblems, we generally avoid ``design by committee.'' Rather, after someinitial discussion, a single individual will produce a proposal.\subsection {Elements of a proposal.}These are the important elements of the ``cleanup'' proposals we develop:\paragraph {Category.}We attempt to distinguish between a clarification (proposal to resolve anambiguity or case of under-specified situation in CLtL), a change (proposal tomake an incompatible change to the language), and an addition (proposal to addan upward compatible feature.) The category of a proposal will likely dictatewhat a responsible implementor of Common Lisp would do prior to the acceptanceof a new draft standard; e.g., clarifications can be adopted immediately, whileincompatible changes might wait until there is an official standard or beimplemented in a separate "package", at which time incompatible changes can beadopted all at once. \paragraph {Problem Description.}Suprisingly, requiring an explicit description of the problem, indpendent ofsome design for its solution, has been most helpful in avoiding unnecessarychanges to the language. Why does anything need to happen at all?  (``If itain't broke, don't fix it.'')\paragraph {Proposal.}We expect proposals to separate out the description of the proposal fromthe arguments for it. Again, this simple measure helps lend a great dealof objectivity to the process. While our proposals are expected to beprecise and accompanied by test cases and examples, we generally look tothe editor and editorial committee of X3J13 to actually produce thespecification that reflects the proposal.\paragraph {Current practice.}What do current Common Lisp implementations do? Current implementations (atleast implementation that attempt to be faithful to CLtL) often give us goodindication of what implementors believed CLtL to mean. We put some faith thatthey attempted a reasonable interpretation.  In cases where no implementationexactly matches CLtL, this is a good indication that CLtL's description isflawed.\paragraph {Costs.}Every change or resolution costs something to adopt: to implementors(What does it take to change a non-conforming implementation to aconforming one? Does this affect some, one, many functions? Ispublic-domain code available?), and to current users (to convertexisting user code or tools.) We hope to give a measure of whether thechanges required for each are small or large. In general, we take costto users more seriously than cost to implementors.\paragraph {Benefits.}Benefits are diverse: our goals are to improve the portability of thelanguage, its performance, the cleanliness of its semantics, and itsaesthetics. Our major concern is with allowing important applications ofCommon Lisp to work well across many different implementations.\section {Open issues.}\renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]{\hspace\labelsep $\bullet$ }This section lists most of the proposals currently being considered, inan extremely abbreviated form. Many of these issues have {\em not} beenadopted and many {\em will not be}; they are listed here to give an ideaof the kinds of issues the cleanup committee is currently addressing.New issues--especially that has affected the portability of any currentprogram--are welcome.Note that the information provided below has been abbreviated considerably forpresentation here. The actual proposals are considerably more elaborate anddescribe both the problem and the proposed solutions in a much more complete way.{\em Reminder: These proposals have not been accepted; they are not part of anystandard. This is a list of issues considered, not of issues passed. While somehave been endorsed by X3J13, others are likely to be rejected.}\paragraph {Clarifications.}These are cases where CLtL does not specify behavior; usually these are alsocases where implementations actually differ and users have found codenon-portable.\begin{description}\item[append-dotted] The functions @\verb|APPEND| and \verb|NCONC| are not currentlydefined for dotted list arguments. An expression such as \verb|(APPEND '(A . B) '(E F))|is effectively an error. It is proposed that, for example, this expression be definedto return \verb|(A E F)|.\item[colon-number] The syntax \verb|:123| refers to a symbol in some implementationsand a number in others due to some fuzziness in the rules for reader tokenization. Itis proposed that we explicitly acknowledge this syntax to be an error so that programmerswill not depend on it in portable code.\item[declaration-scope] The scoping rules for declarations (created by \verb|DECLARE|)are not adequately precise in some situations and are unintuitive in others. This proposaltries to make the rules for declaration scoping more uniform and intuitive.\item[compiler-warning-break] CLtL does not specify whether compiler warnings are affectedby the setting of \verb|*BREAK-ON-WARNINGS*|. It is proposed that they should be.\item[flet-implicit-block] The bodies of functions defined in \verb|FLET|,\verb|MACROLET| and \verb|LABELS| have implicit \verb|BLOCK|s wrapped aroundthem in the same manner as \verb|DEFUN| and \verb|DEFMACRO| bodies.\item[defvar-documentation] In \verb|(DEFVAR variable value documentation)|, CLtL is notclear about whether the documentation is evaluated. The proposed clarification says thatit is not evaluated.\item[defvar-initialization] In \verb|(DEFVAR variable value)|, CLtL is not clear aboutwhen the value is evaluated. The proposed clarification says that it is evaluated,if necessary, at the time the \verb|DEFVAR| expression is executed.\item[pathname-stream] CLtL says that \verb|PATHNAME| can be invoked on a stream, but somestreams (such the one held by \verb|*TERMINAL-IO*| or the one used by \verb|WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING|) may not have associated pathnames. In such cases, it is notclear what \verb|PATHNAME| should return. It is proposed that pathnames be obtainable onlyfrom streams opened with pathnames (e.g., using \verb|OPEN| or \verb|WITH-OPEN-FILE|) orfrom synonym streams to such streams.\item[push-evaluation-order] CLtL is not clear about whether left to right order ofevaluation is guaranteed for {\em all} subexpressions of \verb|PUSH|, or only those withingeneralized variable references. Similar problems occur for other modifying macros,such as \verb|PUSHNEW| and \verb|INCF|.  The proposed clarification states that, forexample, \verb|(PUSH (A) (CAR (B)))| evaluates\verb|(A)| before \verb|(B)|.\item[remf-destruction-unspecified] CLtL specifies little about what kinds of side-effectsare permissible for destructive operators such as \verb|REMF| and \verb|NREVERSE|.In principle, for example, NREVERSE could work by modifying the car parts of its argumentor by modifying the cdr parts. Are both techniques permissible, or is one required?Two main proposals for clarifying this situation are being entertained, one which isbiased towards portability at the expense of efficiency, and another which prefers efficiencyover portability.\item[setf-method-for-symbols] Examples in CLtL of \verb|SETF|-method forsymbols and \verb|LDB| are inconsistent with left-to-right evaluation order.It is proposed that these examples be corrected to make things consistent.\item[shadow-already-present] CLtL is ambiguous about what \verb|SHADOW| does if itreceives a symbol which is already present in the package. There are two validinterpretations, only one of which is useful in practice. A proposed clarificationselects the useful interpretation.\item[sharpsign-plus-minus-package] CLtL is not clear about what package is usedby the \verb|#+| and \verb|#-| when reading the feature names. It is also not clearabout the package in which elements of \verb|*FEATURES*| are intended to appear.Under this proposal, \verb|#+FOO| would refer to a feature named \verb|:FOO|.\item[sharpsign-plus-minus-number] CLtL is not clear about whether numeric featurenames are legal. Multiple proposals are being considered for clarifying this issue.\item[unwind-protect-non-local-exit] CLtL is not clear about what happens if a transfer of control is done from the cleanup clause of an \verb|UNWIND-PROTECT|to a point not inside that clause. Multiple proposals are being considered for clarifyingthis issue, but the one which currently seems to have the most support suggests thattransfer of control from a cleanup clause of an \verb|UNWIND-PROTECT| overrides any unwind in progress at that time.\item[adjust-array-displacement] CLtL is not adequately specific about how\verb|ADJUST-ARRAY| interacts with displaced arrays. A proposal is being entertainedwhich clarifies this relationship.\item[do-symbols-duplicates] CLtL does not say whether \verb|DO-SYMBOLS| can executethe body more than once for a symbol that is accessible in a package through multiplesources. It is expensive to detect such cases, but the failure to detect duplicationsmay surprise some programmers. Several proposals to make the contract of \verb|DO-SYMBOLS|more clear are being discussed.\item[format-atsign-colon] CLtL is ambiguous about whether the colon (\verb|:|) andatsign (\verb|@|) modifiers were allowed to occur in either order in a format directive.It is proposed that \verb|@:| and \verb|:@| be considered interchangeable in formatdirectives.\item[format-colon-uparrow-scope] CLtL is not clear about whether \verb|~:^| in \verb|FORMAT|iterations will test for remaining sublists or test for remaining arguments. Two proposals,corresponding to these two possible interpretations, are being discussed.\item[function-argument-type-semantics] CLtL permits one to declare the argument typesfor functions, but does not say what it means to do so. Several interesting and mutuallyincompatible interpretations of such declarations have been proposed.\item[lisp-symbol-redefinition] CLtL does not explicitly say that it is an errorto redefine or shadow with \verb|FLET|, \verb|MACROLET|, \verb|LABELS| functionsdefined in CLtL. A proposed clarification states clearly that this is an error.\item[princ-character] CLtL does not clearly define the effect of \verb|PRINC| oncharacter arguments. A proposed clarification says that \verb|(PRINC char)| behavesexactly like \verb|(WRITE-CHAR char)|. In particular, \verb|(PRINC #\Tab)| printsa tab character and not the three characters ``\verb|Tab|''.\item[import-setf-symbol-package] CLtL does not say whether \verb|IMPORT| is permittedto change the home package of its argument. A proposed clarification states that it is\verb|IMPORT| has no effect on a symbol's home package.\item[format-op-c] CLtL does not clearly define the effect of \verb|~C| in \verb|FORMAT|.A proposed clarification says that \verb|(FORMAT T "~C" char)| is like \verb|(WRITE-CHAR char)| for characters without bits. The effect for characters withbits would still be implementation-dependent.\item[disassemble-side-effect] CLtL is ambiguous about whether the \verb|DISASSEMBLE|has a side-effect on the function cell of an argument symbol when that symbol denotesan interpreted function that needs to be compiled. A proposed clarification says that\verb|DISASSEMBLE| does not have a side-effect on its argument.\end {description}\paragraph {Additions.}These are some new features we are considering adding to Common Lisp.\begin {description}\item[aref-1d] There is a proposal to add a new primitive \verb|(ROW-MAJOR-AREF array n)|to access the storage of a multi-dimensional array as if the array were a vector.\item[format-comma-interval] There is a proposal to add an option to \verb|FORMAT| which would allow a programmer to specify intervals other than 3 between digit delimitercharacter. For example \verb|(FORMAT NIL "~,,' ,4:B" 17)| would return\verb|"1 0001"|.\item[get-setf-method-environment] There is a proposal to add an environment argument to\verb|GET-SETF-METHOD| so that it can interact more gracefully with \verb|FLET| and\verb|MACROLET|.\item[keyword-argument-name-package] There is a proposal to allow arbitrary symbols askeyword-argument tokens. For example, one could define \verb|(DEFUN F (&KEY ((A B))) B)|and later do \verb|(F 'A 7)|.\item[sequence-functions-exclude-arrays] There are several proposals for how to extendsequence functions to work on multi-dimensional arrays. For example, one might want to do\verb|(FILL array 0)| or \verb|(EVERY #'ODDP array)| for multi-dimensional arrays.\item[assoc-rassoc-if-key] The description of \verb|ASSOC-IF|, \verb|ASSOC-IF-NOT|,\verb|RASSOC-IF| and \verb|RASSOC-IF-NOT| does not allow for the \verb|:KEY| argumentpermitted by \verb|ASSOC| and \verb|RASSOC|. There is a proposal to correct this apparently accidental omission.\item[reduce-argument-extraction] There is currently no way for \verb|REDUCE| to select only part of each element in a sequence as the part to be reduced. A \verb|:KEY| argumenthas been proposed so that one might write \verb|(REDUCE #'+ ASTRONAUTS :KEY #'PERSON-AGE))|rather than having to write \verb|(REDUCE #'+ (MAP 'LIST #'PARSE-AGE ASTRONAUTS))|.\item[setf-function-vs-macro] There is a proposal to introduce the concept of a \verb|SETF|function to complement the existing \verb|SETF| macro facility. For example, one mightwrite \verb|(DEFUN (SETF KAR) (NEW-KAR KONS) (RPLAKA KONS NEW-KAR) NEW-KAR)| to describe what\verb|(SETF (KAR X) Y)| means.\item[pathname-subdirectory-list] There is currently no advice to implementors about howto represent hierarchical file directory components in a pathname. It is proposed thata list of strings naming the subdirectories be used in this case.\item[stream-class-access] It is proposed that there be functions for discriminating betweenthe various classes of streams, and for accessing the components of certain streams.\item[structure-definition-access] There is a proposal to add functions for accessinginformation about \verb|DEFSTRUCT| slots.\item[trace-function-only] There is a proposal to enhance the arguments to \verb|TRACE| sothat things other than ordinary named functions can be traced.\end {description}\paragraph {Changes.}These proposals are generally incompatible changes to the language, although insome cases they are consistent with CLtL.\begin {description}\item There is discussion of requiring \verb|STREAM|, \verb|PACKAGE|, \verb|PATHNAME|,\verb|READTABLE|, and \verb|RANDOM-STATE| to be disjoint types.\item[pathname-symbol] There is a proposal to disallow implicit coercion of a symbolto a pathname. For example, \verb|(LOAD 'MYFILE)| would be an error.\item[declare-macros] There is a proposal to disallow the ability of a macro to expandinto a declaration. For example, in \verb|(LET (A B) (MY-DECLARE) ...)|, the expression\verb|(MY-DECLARE)| is currently permitted to expand into \verb|(DECLARE (SPECIAL A))|.It is proposed that this flexibility be removed.\item[function-type] Currently, \verb|FUNCTIONP| is true of ``real'' functions, symbols,and lists with \verb|LAMBDA| in the car position. It has been proposed that the\verb|FUNCTION| type should be distinct from any other type, and that \verb|FUNCTIONP| should be true only of ``real'' functions (not symbols or lists). Bundled in with proposalare suggestions that \verb|FUNCTION| should be required to return an object of type\verb|FUNCTION| and that automatic coercion from symbols to functions by \verb|FUNCALL|, \verb|APPLY|, etc. should be disallowed.\item[defmacro-body-lexical-environment] It is proposed that \verb|DEFMACRO| and\verb|DEFTYPE| bodies should be allowed to have a lexical environment.\end {description}\section {Open problems.}There are a number of areas that are currently not being addressed,either by the cleanup committee or by other current committee's ofX3J13. We would like to see some attempts at standardizing on thoseareas that are most concern to users attempting to write portable code.One is that with the acceptance of a reasonable signal system, the hardwork of specifying the signals which may be raised by various errorconditions remain.  We would like to make a part of the standardinterface to functions the classes of errors they can invoke undervarious circumstances.No work is currently going on in the area of specifying reference tomulti-programming features, although many implementations of Common Lispinclude them.There are several problems in the language specification for which wehave no good proposals. Most of these involve interactions of the manyfunctions in the Common Lisp library, e.g., how \verb|EQUAL| behaves on\verb|DEFSTRUCT| objects.  We believe these items need to bestandardized, but have not found a reasonable design.\end{document}*start*22451 00024 US Date:  2 Mar 88 20:31From: KMP%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics:COM:XeroxSubject: Revised articleTo: Masinter:PA:Xerox, Masinter:PARC:Xeroxcc: KMP%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics:COM:XeroxGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Revised articleTo: Masinter.PA, Masinter.PARCcc: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMReturn-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by Xerox.COM ; 02 MAR 88 20:31:15 PSTReceived: from RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 355081; Wed 2-Mar-88 23:30:29 ESTOriginal-Date: Wed, 2 Mar 88 23:30 ESTMessage-ID: <880302233014.0.KMP@RIO-DE-JANEIRO.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>GVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVI've been sick with a very bad cold since the day I returned to Boston.Today was my first day back at work.

It describes some fundamental assumptions of our work inthis sub-committee, the process we use to consider changes, and a sampler ofsome of the changes we are considering.\section{Assumptions.}We believed the only reasonable way to obtain a standard for Lisp was to startwith a known, widely implemented description, namely ``Common Lisp theLanguage'' by Guy L. Steele Jr. ({\em CLtL}) and to consider individuallyvarious clarifications, changes, additions, enhancements, modifications.Common Lisp ``works''. It is widely implemented. Common Lisp has arelatively small kernel of semantics, facilities for extensions, and alarge library of data types and operations on them. It is a goodstarting point for a Lisp standard.  We do not believe that it isnecessary to start over to design a good Lisp standard.  Even if onefavors modifications to the fundamentals of the language semantics(e.g., function and variable name scoping), most of the library of datatypes and operations of Common Lisp will continue to form a good basisfor applications and it is valuable to clarify the operation of thelibrary.There are three kinds of problems with CLtL we would like to resolve increating a standard.First, CLtL had its roots in a user's level description of a programmingsystem; although it is wonderfully specific as user manuals go, thereare numerous places that allow more implementation flexibility than isdesirable in a standard.  In a standard, we would expect thatambiguities to be either eliminated or else {em explicitly} allowed.Secondly, CLtL was written and published without extensive prior use of some ofits features; a few have turned out to be unworkable or useless and notimplemented. We hope to change or remove those features.Third, we've discovered that there are features that exist in nearly in everyimplementation but with different names and calling conventions or (in a veryfew instances) are logical extensions of the current specification. We wouldlike to augment the standard by providing access from the standard language tothose features.\section {The process.}The cleanup subcommittee considers those minor changes that are not beingaddressed by any of the other single-topic subcommittees of X3J13 (objects,windows and graphics, characters, iteration, compilation, validation, and a fewothers.)We consider proposals both internally generated by members of the cleanupcommittee or are received from members of the community.Almost all work of the committee is handled via electronic mail. Werarely meet as a group in person. Most decisions are made by consensus.When we cannot agree by consensus whether to endorse a proposal, we maypresent it to X3J13 for voting with the various points of viewrepresented in the writeup; we believe our responsibility is to fullydescribe the issues, and allow the larger community to vote.We attempt to analyze the costs and benefits for each proposed modification.Each proposal, considered individually, must make the language better--enoughbetter to be worth the cost of making a change.  To this end, we require thateach proposal be accompanied by an analysis of the various costs and benefits.Of course, there are conflicts in the interpretation of costs and benefits.  There are some general principles of good programming language design:programs should be easy to read; programs should be easy to write; thelanguage should allow users to write efficient prgrams. These goalssometimes work against each other: for example, adding features makesthe job easier for the program writer, but harder for the reader. Theseconflicts in desired make the design process difficult, because it isnot possible to optimize all of the design goals simultaneously.The process of explicitly addressing costs and benefits has successfullyeliminated arguments based merely on personal preference. Most often, whatinitially seems like a matter of taste in fact has roots in a more explicitjudgment of benefit over cost. By adopting an explicit format for those items,we've managed to expose the underlying principles.We only consider ``complete'' proposals. While we've discussed some openproblems, we generally avoid ``design by committee.'' Rather, after someinitial discussion, a single individual will produce a proposal.\subsection {Elements of a proposal.}These are the important elements of the ``cleanup'' proposals we develop:\paragraph {Category.}We attempt to distinguish between a clarification (proposal to resolve anambiguity or case of under-specified situation in CLtL), a change (proposal tomake an incompatible change to the language), and an addition (proposal to addan upward compatible feature.) The category of a proposal will likely dictatewhat a responsible implementor of Common Lisp would do prior to the acceptanceof a new draft standard; e.g., clarifications can be adopted immediately, whileincompatible changes might wait until there is an official standard or beimplemented in a separate "package", at which time incompatible changes can beadopted all at once. \paragraph {Problem Description.}Suprisingly, requiring an explicit description of the problem, indpendent ofsome design for its solution, has been most helpful in avoiding unnecessarychanges to the language. Why does anything need to happen at all?  (``If itain't broke, don't fix it.'')\paragraph {Proposal.}We expect proposals to separate out the description of the proposal fromthe arguments for it. Again, this simple measure helps lend a great dealof objectivity to the process. While our proposals are expected to beprecise and accompanied by test cases and examples, we generally look tothe editor and editorial committee of X3J13 to actually produce thespecification that reflects the proposal.\paragraph {Current practice.}What do current Common Lisp implementations do? Current implementations (atleast implementation that attempt to be faithful to CLtL) often give us goodindication of what implementors believed CLtL to mean. We put some faith thatthey attempted a reasonable interpretation.  In cases where no implementationexactly matches CLtL, this is a good indication that CLtL's description isflawed.\paragraph {Costs.}Every change or resolution costs something to adopt: to implementors(What does it take to change a non-conforming implementation to aconforming one? Does this affect some, one, many functions? Ispublic-domain code available?), and to current users (to convertexisting user code or tools.) We hope to give a measure of whether thechanges required for each are small or large. In general, we take costto users more seriously than cost to implementors.\paragraph {Benefits.}Benefits are diverse: our goals are to improve the portability of thelanguage, its performance, the cleanliness of its semantics, and itsaesthetics. Our major concern is with allowing important applications ofCommon Lisp to work well across many different implementations.\section {Open issues.}\renewcommand{\descriptionlabel}[1]{\hspace\labelsep $\bullet$ }This section lists most of the proposals currently being considered, inan extremely abbreviated form. Many of these issues have {\em not} beenadopted and many {\em will not be}; they are listed here to give an ideaof the kinds of issues the cleanup committee is currently addressing.New issues--especially that has affected the portability of any currentprogram--are welcome.Note that the information provided below has been abbreviated considerably forpresentation here.

The proposed clarification says thatit is not evaluated.\item[defvar-initialization] In \verb|(DEFVAR variable value)|, CLtL is not clear aboutwhen the value is evaluated. The proposed clarification says that it is evaluated,if necessary, at the time the \verb|DEFVAR| expression is executed.\item[pathname-stream] CLtL says that \verb|PATHNAME| can be invoked on a stream, but somestreams (such the one held by \verb|*TERMINAL-IO*| or the one used by \verb|WITH-INPUT-FROM-STRING|) may not have associated pathnames.

A proposed clarification says that\verb|DISASSEMBLE| does not have a side-effect on its argument.\end {description}\paragraph {Additions.}These are some new features we are considering adding to Common Lisp.\begin {description}\item[aref-1d] There is a proposal to add a new primitive \verb|(ROW-MAJOR-AREF array n)|to access the storage of a multi-dimensional array as if the array were a vector.\item[format-comma-interval] There is a proposal to add an option to \verb|FORMAT| which would allow a programmer to specify intervals other than 3 between digit delimitercharacter. For example \verb|(FORMAT NIL "~,,' ,4:B" 17)| would return\verb|"1 0001"|.\item[get-setf-method-environment] There is a proposal to add an environment argument to\verb|GET-SETF-METHOD| so that it can interact more gracefully with \verb|FLET| and\verb|MACROLET|.\item[keyword-argument-name-package] There is a proposal to allow arbitrary symbols askeyword-argument tokens. For example, one could define \verb|(DEFUN F (&KEY ((A B))) B)|and later do \verb|(F 'A 7)|.\item[sequence-functions-exclude-arrays] There are several proposals for how to extendsequence functions to work on multi-dimensional arrays. For example, one might want to do\verb|(FILL array 0)| or \verb|(EVERY #'ODDP array)| for multi-dimensional arrays.\item[assoc-rassoc-if-key] The description of \verb|ASSOC-IF|, \verb|ASSOC-IF-NOT|,\verb|RASSOC-IF| and \verb|RASSOC-IF-NOT| does not allow for the \verb|:KEY| argumentpermitted by \verb|ASSOC| and \verb|RASSOC|. There is a proposal to correct this apparently accidental omission.\item[reduce-argument-extraction] There is currently no way for \verb|REDUCE| to select only part of each element in a sequence as the part to be reduced. A \verb|:KEY| argumenthas been proposed so that one might write \verb|(REDUCE #'+ ASTRONAUTS :KEY #'PERSON-AGE))|rather than having to write \verb|(REDUCE #'+ (MAP 'LIST #'PARSE-AGE ASTRONAUTS))|.\item[setf-function-vs-macro] There is a proposal to introduce the concept of a \verb|SETF|function to complement the existing \verb|SETF| macro facility. For example, one mightwrite \verb|(DEFUN (SETF KAR) (NEW-KAR KONS) (RPLAKA KONS NEW-KAR) NEW-KAR)| to describe what\verb|(SETF (KAR X) Y)| means.\item[pathname-subdirectory-list] There is currently no advice to implementors about howto represent hierarchical file directory components in a pathname. It is proposed thata list of strings naming the subdirectories be used in this case.\item[stream-class-access] It is proposed that there be functions for discriminating betweenthe various classes of streams, and for accessing the components of certain streams.\item[structure-definition-access] There is a proposal to add functions for accessinginformation about \verb|DEFSTRUCT| slots.\item[trace-function-only] There is a proposal to enhance the arguments to \verb|TRACE| sothat things other than ordinary named functions can be traced.\end {description}\paragraph {Changes.}These proposals are generally incompatible changes to the language, although insome cases they are consistent with CLtL.\begin {description}\item There is discussion of requiring \verb|STREAM|, \verb|PACKAGE|, \verb|PATHNAME|,\verb|READTABLE|, and \verb|RANDOM-STATE| to be disjoint types.\item[pathname-symbol] There is a proposal to disallow implicit coercion of a symbolto a pathname. For example, \verb|(LOAD 'MYFILE)| would be an error.\item[declare-macros] There is a proposal to disallow the ability of a macro to expandinto a declaration. For example, in \verb|(LET (A B) (MY-DECLARE) ...)|, the expression\verb|(MY-DECLARE)| is currently permitted to expand into \verb|(DECLARE (SPECIAL A))|.It is proposed that this flexibility be removed.\item[function-type] Currently, \verb|FUNCTIONP| is true of ``real'' functions, symbols,and lists with \verb|LAMBDA| in the car position. It has been proposed that the\verb|FUNCTION| type should be distinct from any other type, and that \verb|FUNCTIONP| should be true only of ``real'' functions (not symbols or lists). Bundled in with proposalare suggestions that \verb|FUNCTION| should be required to return an object of type\verb|FUNCTION| and that automatic coercion from symbols to functions by \verb|FUNCALL|, \verb|APPLY|, etc. should be disallowed.\item[defmacro-body-lexical-environment] It is proposed that \verb|DEFMACRO| and\verb|DEFTYPE| bodies should be allowed to have a lexical environment.\end {description}\section {Open problems.}There are a number of areas that are currently not being addressed,either by the cleanup committee or by other current committee's ofX3J13. We would like to see some attempts at standardizing on thoseareas that are most concern to users attempting to write portable code.One is that with the acceptance of a reasonable signal system, the hardwork of specifying the signals which may be raised by various errorconditions remain.  We would like to make a part of the standardinterface to functions the classes of errors they can invoke undervarious circumstances.No work is currently going on in the area of specifying reference tomulti-programming features, although many implementations of Common Lispinclude them.There are several problems in the language specification for which wehave no good proposals. Most of these involve interactions of the manyfunctions in the Common Lisp library, e.g., how \verb|EQUAL| behaves on\verb|DEFSTRUCT| objects.  We believe these items need to bestandardized, but have not found a reasonable design.\end{document} *start*02231 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 04 MAR 88 09:38:00 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 4 Mar 88  09:32:20 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 04 MAR 88 09:32:39 PSTDate: 4 Mar 88 09:32 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: Compiler cleanup issues, againIn-reply-to: sandra%orion@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)'s message of Tue, 1 Mar 88 16:15:28 MSTTo: sandra%orion@cs.utah.educc: smh%franz.uucp@ucbarpa.berkeley.edu, ram@c.cs.cmu.edu, mike%acorn@LIVE-OAK.LCS.MIT.EDU, cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <880304-093239-8035@Xerox>Sandra, I agree with you that if the compiler committee can't revive itself weshould take some more drastic action. Whether the cleanup committee does it oranother, new committee, (e.g., with you as chair), following the same model ofcleanup is less clear to me.The problem with most of the proposals is that many of them require theintroduction of a new computational model for Common Lisp, with the followingattributes:* clear definitions and descriptions of the relationships between read-time,macro-expansion-time, lexical-analysis-time (compilation), and execution-time* a clear(er) distinction between top-level and non-top-level* the semantics of a "file" vs the interactive top level (read-eval-print) loop* a model for errors which is more fine grained than the current "is an error","signals an error" and "must"* a model for the semantics of declarationsThe cleanup committee's proposal format and discussion mechanism isn't wellsuited for concept definition. Given an accepted computational model, we canconsider, as cleanups, various changes to Common Lisp to bring things more inline with that computational model. Perhaps it would help to try to separate outthe concept definition from cleanup proposals.If previous experience holds, it may be that there will be iterations in theconcept definitions as various cleanup proposals are discussed.My recollection is that "RAM's compiler proposal" combines both conceptdefinition and also proposals for changes to the language.*start*01205 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 04 MAR 88 11:43:09 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 4 Mar 88  11:40:35 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 04 MAR 88 11:32:47 PSTDate: 4 Mar 88 11:31 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Cleanup subcommittee meeting, Tuesday 15 March, 9:00-12:00To: CL-Cleanup@sail.stanford.edu, vanroggen%aitg.decnet@hudson.dec.comcc: Masinter.paMessage-ID: <880304-113247-8304@Xerox>The cleanup subcommittee will meet at Xerox PARC Tuesday 15 March, 9:00-12:00.If you've not been here before, the address is3333 Coyote Hill RoadPalo Alto, CA 94304It is at the corner of Coyote Hill and Hillview, near the corner of Page MillRoad and Foothill Expressway.My phone number is (415) 494-4365. I propose for the agenda that we take the list of current open issues (i.e., theones in the "in discussion" list) and spend a maximum of 5 minutes each seeingwho, if anyone, has some comment or opinion on the issue.I think we will want to also reserve 30 minutes to talk about the schedule fordealing with issues.*start*00533 00024 US Date:  4 Mar 88 11:57 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Re: Revised articleIn-reply-to: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>'s message of Wed, 2 Mar 88 23:30 ESTTo: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMcc: Masinter.PA, Masinter.PARCImportant edit:"This section lists most of the proposals currently being considered"=>"This section lists some examples of proposals currently being considered."In fact, it is only about 30% of the issues, and some of the ones in the list are dead, etc.*start*01046 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU by Xerox.COM ; 07 MAR 88 09:39:28 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 7 Mar 88  09:36:50 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 07 MAR 88 09:29:04 PSTDate: 7 Mar 88 09:27 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: New issues for the "pending" list, from JapanTo: cl-cleanup@Sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <880307-092904-1841@Xerox>These issues were derived from the list submitted by the Japanese technicalworking group on Lisp.

Dick Gabriel.	    Countries participating were:  Canada, Commission of the	      European Community, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan,	      Netherlands, Switzerland, UK, and US.  Position of each	      country presented, demonstrating wide diversity of opinion.	    US Delegation included Dick Gabriel (project editor), Bob	      Mathis, Will Clinger (project editor), Patrick Dussud, Larry	      Masinter, Kent Pitman, Thom Linden, and John McCarthy.	    Votes were taken which Dick Gabriel stated to the ISO group	      had to be tentative on his part since he wished to come back	      to this group for advice.	      1. Majority vote was to concentrate first on a short-term		standard.	      2. Some characteristics of the standard, by preference:		portable, efficient, clear semantics and simple semantics.	      3. Most popular departure points were Common Lisp, Scheme,		and Eulisp.	      4. The majority vote was for the name ISLISP.	      5. Responsibilities were distributed.  US volunteered		documents, rather than volunteers, for OOP, Functions,		Macros, Multiprocessing, Character Set, Windows,		Conditions, Iteration.	Bob Mathis emphasized to X3J13 that		individuals could volunteer.10:30 am Break10:45 am Item 5  Item 5 (Doc: 88-002, 88-003, 88-004), Guy Steele.	    Chapter 1 and 2.	    The purpose of having an implementation result being undefined	      was shown to be that of having the result be undocumented so	      that a user could not rely on the result (for example, use of	      multiple ELSE in an IF).	    JonL White expressed concern that the use of the name "symbol	      class" would continue a direction, which he considered	      misguided, on nomenclature on symbol-value.  A broader	      question was raised as one reply that CLOS committee could	      not address the entire issue of nomenclature in Common Lisp.	    Expressed concerns:  voting on chapters 1 and 2 separate from	      3; voting on chapters 1 and 2 without knowing how it fits	      into CLTL; voting at this meeting rather than waiting until	      reply from written comments integrated into chapters 1 and 2;	      defining a continuing mechanism (ie.  cleanup committee) for	      continuing changes to chapters 1 and 2); defining a new	      subcommittee to define the layering of Common Lisp.12:10 pm Item 6 Lunch 1:00 pm Item 7 CLOS Continuation	    The following motion was moved and unanimously passed:	      X3J13 and the CLOS Subcommittee agree on the following:	      1.  X#J13 members will read and give comments on Document	      88-002 (Chapters 1 and 2 of the CLOS Specification) by April	      21, 1988.  Comments can be sent via electronic mail to:		common-lisp-object-system@sail.stanford.edu	      2.  The CLOS Subcommittee will consider all comments, prepare	      a revised draft of Chapters 1 and 2, and prepare a written	      summary of how they addressed the comments.  These documents	      will be distributed to X3J13 members in advance of the June	      X3J13 meeting.	      3.  At the June meeting, the X3J13 Committee will vote	      whether or not to accept Chapters 1 and 2 out of the CLOS	      Subcommittee.	    Vote of thanks to the CLOS Subcommittee for their	      work was moved and unanimously passed.	    Chapter 3.	    Gregor Kiczales presented a summary of the status of the	      Metaobject Protocol (Chapter 3 of the CLOS Specification	      88-003).	    Moved by Barry Margolin, seconded by Dan Bobrow.	      Approve the general direction of the Metaobject Protocol of	      CLOS (as specified in 88-003), and recommend that the Object	      Subcommittee continue working on this with an eye toward a	      new draft prior to the fall meeting with the expectation that	      we would then have a one month written comment period prior	      to the winter meeting followed by a vote to move it out of	      subcommittee at the winter meeting.  Motion passed	      unanimously by voice vote. 2:30 pm  Afternoon break 2:40 pm  Item 10  Item 10  Cleanup, Larry Masinter.	    Moved and passed by voice vote 10-7: To postpone the vote on	      the bundled cleanup issues until tomorrow morning.	    Bundled Issues:	      ADJUST_ARRAY_DISPLACEMENT	      APPEND_DOTTED	      AREF_1D	      ASSOC_RASSOC_IF_KEY	      COLON_NUMBER	      DEFVAR_DOCUMENTATION	      DISASSEMBLE_SIDE_EFFECT	      DO_SYMBOLS_DUPLICATES	      DRIBBLE_TECHNIQUE	      FLET_DECLARATION	      FORMAT_COMMA_INTERVAL	      FORMAT_COLON_UPARROW_SCOPE	      FUNCTION_TYPE_KEY_NAME	      GET_SETF_METHOD_ENVIRONMENT	      KEYWORD_ARGUMENT_NAME_PACKAGE	      PATHNAME_STREAM	      PATHNAME_SYMBOL	      PUSH_EVALUATION_ORDER	      REDUCE_ARGUMENT_EXTRACTION	      SHADOW_ALREADY_PRESENT	      SHARPSIGN_PLUS_MINUS_PACKAGE	    Unbundled Issues to be separately considered:	      COMPILER_WARNING_BREAK	      DECLARE_MACROS	      FUNCTION_TYPE_REST_LIST_ELEMENT	      FUNCTION_TYPE	      SETF_FUNCTION_VS_MACRO	      SEQUENCE_FUNCTIONS_EXCLUDE_ARRAYS	    Larry Masinter led a discussion of cleanup issues which were	      not sent to members prior to this meeting.

Bob Mathis09:15 am  Item 10   Item 10  Cleanup, Larry Masinter	    Moved by Dave Slater and seconded by Dan Pierson that the	      bundled cleanup issues be accepted in a single vote and	      the unbundled cleanup issues be accepted on separate votes.	      The motion passed by unanimous voice vote.	    COMPILER_WARNING_BREAK - A majority voice vote and a majority	      company vote rejected the addition of COMPILER_WARNING_BREAK.	    DECLARE_MACROS - Cris Perdue moved and Dick Gabriel seconded	      a motion to stop discussion of DECLARE_MACROS.  The motion	      was passed by majority company vote.  A majority company vote	      accepted the addition of DECLARE_MACROS.	    FUNCTION_TYPE_REST_LIST_ELEMENT - JonL White moved and Barry	      Margolin seconded to table the previous motion to accept	      FUNCTION_TYPE_REST_LIST_ELEMENT.	The motion passed by	      company vote 16-7.	    FUNCTION_TYPE - Unanimous straw vote showed a belief that	      redefinition of some type was necessary (FUNCTION_TYPE).	      Unanimous straw vote showed that some change was needed	      rather than the status quo.  Majority (all but 2) straw vote	      showed sentiment was against the conservative proposal.	      Majority straw vote passed to not accept 2E as written, but	      rather to amend 2E so that FUNCALL and APPLY can accept	      anything that can be coerced to a function.  A straw vote by	      company was called to accept 6B.	The straw vote passed	      (14-7-4).  Barry Margolin moved and Jim Antonisse seconded to	      table the previous motion to accept FUNCTION_TYPE and to ask	      the subcommittee to resubmit FUNCTION_TYPE with changes in	      line with the straw votes.  The motion passed (20-1-3).  Dick	      Gabriel moved and Dan Pierson seconded that the conservative	      proposal be immediately accepted.  This was unanimously	      rejected by company vote (0-25-0).11:15 pm Break11:30 pm General comments	    SETF_FUNCTION_VS_MACRO - As agreed yesterday, this issue is	      tabled until after the function specification report.	    SEQUENCE_FUNCTIONS_EXCLUDE_ARRAYS - The motion to generalize	      SEQUENCE_FUNCTIONS_EXCLUDE_ARRAYS passed (15-6-3).  Dick	      Gabriel moved and Dan Pierson seconded that the discussion be	      reopened.  The motion passed by majority company vote.  David	      Moon moved to call the question to a vote to generalize SEQ	      ...  The vote was rejected (3-18-3).12:15 pm Item 11 Lunch01:15 pm Item 12  Item 12   Status of Standard, Kathy Chapman	    After describing the phases of document preparation, concern	      was expressed whether an early version of the document would	      be available or whether the cost in time and money would make	      an early version impractical.  A straw vote unanimously	      passed to require members wishing to review the document to	      specifically ask for the document and pay for duplication and	      mailing.	Kathy has been asked for a more detailed plan for	      distribution and review at the next meeting.02:00 pm    Status of Scheme Standard, David Bartley	    Scheme standardization is under consideration in a	      microprocessor group of IEEE.  This umbrella is also working	      toward the standardization of MODULA/2, SMALLTALK, FORTH,	      and PILOT.02:15 pm Item 15  Item 15   Other committee reports	    MACRO SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT, Julian Padget	    There has been no subcommittee meeting since the last X3J13	      meeting.	Two people responded to a request for interesting	      macros.  Julian reiterated his request and also asked for new	      volunteers.  Send any information to:		padget@maths.bath.ac.uk	    CHARACTER SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT, Thom Linden	    A detailed proposal was presented of the work done to date.	      Several strawvotes presented moderate support for the	      direction of parts of the proposal.03:20 pm Break03:30 pm Announcements, Bob Mathis03:35 pm Item 15 (cont.)  Item 15   ITERATION SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT, Jon L. White	    The status of LOOPS and the work being currently done in OSS	      was described.  Pavel Curtis discussed ITERATE and GATHERING.	      Concern was expressed with the concept of the iteration	      constructs being "portable, optional".	    COMPILER SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT, Steve Haflich	    Steve described a model to be used to figure out what a compile	      file does.04:35 pm Item 14  Item 14   Condition System, Andy Daniels	      Comments have stopped so version 18 of proposal seems	      stabilized.  Open issues are still open but can be completed	      as cleanup.  Straw vote showed that the directions are right	      and that the proposal should be presented for acceptance at	      the June meeting.  Volunteers are requested to flesh out	      specification.05:00 pm Item 13  Item 13   Function Specs, JonL White	    JonL described the overview and goals of the specifications.  A	      proposal is forthcoming. Unanimous straw vote to encourage	      the subcommittee to continue its work and to present a	      proposal.05:35 am  Item 10 (cont.)   Item 10  Cleanup, Larry Masinter	    SETF_FUNCTION_VS_MACRO - Unanimous straw vote showed that	      discussion should be closed. Dan Pierson moved and Guy Steele	      seconded the motion to table SETF...  The motion passed by a	      majority voice vote.  Committee thanked Larry Masinter for	      bringing forward these issues in such good condition and	      Larry thanked his subcommittee.06:00 Item AdjournmentMinutes submitted by Mary S.

For example, at the last meeting of X3J13 in late March (in Palo Alto), Andy Daniels gave the presentation on the error/signal system, which stands a good chance of being adopted into the standard, and Gregor Kiczales gave a report on the meta-object protocol (chapter 3 of CLOS). Almost all of the "cleanup" items presented were adopted. The ISO work is just beginning; the early March meeting in Paris was the first meeting of WG16. The only official votes were that the name of the standard would be ISLISP (rather than, say, LISP, or COMMON LISP) and that the standard would start with Common Lisp, as modified by the cleanup items of X3J13 but also with several other significant issues addressed. On a side note:One item probably of interest to others at Xerox is the issue of international character set handling within Lisp; while SC22 has directed its working groups to address the issue, it doesn't seem like other programming languages have much to contribute. Lisp may lead the other standards here, since Common Lisp takes a stronger stand at distinguishing between character codes and characters as objects than other languages. The issues of character encoding and programming language interface are related but quite different. The major issues here are in dealing with things like JIS (which has two different codes for A) ,  processing on systems that allow multiple character encodings, whether there is a standard for "upper case" and "lower case" which can be adopted for the Lisp functions which work on English, whether the standard requires that accented characters in European languages read as a single character object (independent of the number of bytes it takes to represent), etc.From the outside, the SC22 representative's report on SC2 activity was very discouraging, there seem to be few guidelines.  It would help in the battle against multiple character sets if there were at least some statement from SC2 on some of these issues.*start*00977 00024 US Return-Path: <chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.com>Received: from decwrl.dec.com by Xerox.COM ; 29 MAR 88 18:29:43 PSTReceived: by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.4/4.7.34)	id AA10828; Tue, 29 Mar 88 11:00:05 PSTDate: Tue, 29 Mar 88 11:00:05 PSTMessage-Id: <8803291900.AA10828@decwrl.dec.com>From: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comTo: masinter.pa, CHAPMAN%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comSubject: comments on issue list1.

Attendees were:      Skona Brittain       Barry Margolin      Kathy Chapman        Larry Masinter      Linda deMicheal      Guy Steele      Dick Gabriel         Walter van Roggen      Sonya Keene          Bob Mathis(did I leave anyone out?)           This memo summarizes the important results  of  the  meeting,      and lists the action items from the meeting.      2  SUMMARY           In  general,  the  attendees  felt  that  the  schedule   for      completion   of  the  standard  was  agressive,  but  doable.   In      addition,  there  is  an  increased  interest  in  completing  the      standard  on,  or ahead of, schedule, due to the commitment the US      has made to the ISLISP group.  Following are the decisions made by      the attendees.      1.  The outline and contents of the chapters of the standard  have          been  modified.   The  next  section  of this memo details the          changes.      2.  A formal specification of the base forms of CL will  be  done.          It  will  begin in July or sooner.  Initially the work will be          done by Dick Gabriel and Kathy Chapman.  It is hoped that Will          Clinger  and  Jonathan  Rees will have time to assist with the          effort.      3.  It was decided that the use of a large set of special fonts in          explanatory material (will be Chapter 3 in the new outline) is          distracting to the reader.  Therefore, special fonts will only          be employed to a limited extent in Chapter 3, but will be used          more extensively in Chapter 4 (see Action Items section).                                                                Page 2      4.  It was decided that the  use  of  a  professional  indexer  is          probably desirable (see Action Items section).      5.  The reader syntax and semantic rules, and other semantic rules          of  the  language CL, will be specified in natural language in          the form of a set of evaluation rules.  These will  appear  in          Chapters 2 and 3 (see outline in the next section) (see Action          Items section).      6.  It was decided that the issues surrounding language extensions          should be examined in detail (see Action Items section).      7.  A new list of parts of the document to be reviewed, when  they          will  be ready for review, and who is to review them, is to be          constructed (see Action Items section).      3  NEW OUTLINE AND CONTENTS OF STANDARD CHAPTERS           Following is the new outline for the CL standard.      1.  Chapter 1 - Introduction - Same outline as current chapter  1;          font  key  explanation  is  expanded,  compliance  section  is          rewritten with clarity in mind, language extensions section is          modified (see Action Items).      2.  Chapter 2 - Evaluation - This chapter  will  contain  a  clear          model  of  read,  eval,  phases  of processing...  (see Action          Items).      3.  Chapter 3 - Concepts - This chapter will contain the following          information:          1.  A description of the Lisp reader, and a forward  reference              to the read function.  In addition, the character set will              appear  first,  and  all  the  syntactic   characteristics              (whether  they  involve  `special'  tokens  or  not), will              appear in the list of operators.          2.  The data types section will contain an explanation of  the              way CL uses data types.          3.  The basic language constructs section  will  be  moved  to              Chapter 2 (the evaluation model).          4.  The rest of this chapter will contain information  similar              to   what   is   contained   in  Chapter  1  of  the  CLOS              specification, i.e., an explanation of  how  the  language              works   with  forward  pointers  to  forms  that  will  be              explained in detail (but autonomously) in Chapter 4.                                                                Page 3      4.  Chapter 4 - Form, Constant, and Variable Descriptions  -  This          chapter  now includes the information that had previously been          a part of Chapters 4, 5, and 7.  Following  are  some  details          about how this chapter will look.          1.  All  functions,  macros,  special  forms,  constants,  and              variables   that   are   part   of   CL   will  be  listed              alphabetically.  All  entries  with  non-alpha  characters              appearing  in  the first position of the name of the entry              will be positioned at the end of the alphabetic list,  and              will  be  alphabetized  according  to  the  first alpha or              numeric character appearing in the name of the entry.          2.  The  `Inputs'  and  `Outputs'   labels   in   the   f/m/sf              descriptions  are  changed  to  `Arguments'  and `Values',              respectively.          3.  The `Base' label is removed, and the fact that a f/m/sf is              part of the base is notated under the label `Notes'.          4.  A `Side Effects' label has been added.          5.  A `See Also' label was suggested; however, its meaning  in              a  strict specification is not clear.  For example, does a              See Also reference mean that the  information  pointed  to              somehow  affects  the result of the evaluation of the form              being described?  Please comment on the addition of a `See              Also' label.      5.  Chapter 5 - Syntax - same as current Chapter 8.      6.  Chapter 6 - Semantics - same as current Chapter 9.                                                                Page 4      4  ACTION ITEMS           Following is a list of action items resulting from  both  the      subcommittee meeting, and the X3J13 committee meeting.  Please let      me know if I missed any items, or  have  incorrectly  assigned  an      item to a person.      Responsible people        Action Item      Kathy Chapman             Get X3 to pay for professional indexer      Kathy Chapman             Create a format for proposal submission      Barry Margolin            Create a proposal on how language extensions are      Larry Masinter            to be handled      Guy Steele                Create an evaluation model strawman      Dick Gabriel      Kathy Chapman             Create a review cycle proposal for editorial                                committee reviews                            Kathy Chapman             Create a review proposal for X3J13 committee      Kathy Chapman             Contact typesetter to review font usage      5  OPEN ISSUES           Following is a list of decisions that  have  to  be  made  at      future meetings.      1.  Will new language features (like  CLOS)  be  imbedded  in  the          document or will they appear as a supplement?      2.  Should we specifically try to include the ISO community in our          review cycles?      3.  Other issues?      6  SUMMARY           The  people  that  reviewed  the  document  provided   highly      valuable  technical  insight  and corrections.  In order for us to      make this document as correct as possible, it  will  be  necessary      for  this sort of review to continue to the document's completion.                                                                Page 5      As the document becomes larger and larger,  this  sort  of  review      becomes more and more intimidating and time-consuming.  Therefore,      I'd like to request help now working out the review cycle details,      and  later  changing the review cycle algorithm if it doesn't work      for you.  It would be much better to speak up if  you  don't  have      time to review your part than to leave it left unread.           The first request I have may be the  most  important  to  our      success.   A  review  cycle plan will be coming to you within this      month.  Please review it carefully, analyze the time you will have      to  spend  on  this effort, and propose a task you can comfortably      accomplish.  If I don't hear from you concerning the review  cycle      plan,  I  will  assume you do not wish to review the standard.  If      you are passing the document around to other people,  please  make      sure  they  realize  that  their timely review is necessary to the      success of this effort.  An unreviewed section  could  potentially      remain  untouched, and perhaps will be wrong.  Urge the people you      are counting on to review certain parts to only volunteer  for  as      much as they can handle.*start*13748 00024 US Date: 28 Apr 88 02:11 PDTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: [Masinter.pa: Current issue status]cc: Masinter.paDate: 14 Mar 88 00:13 PSTFrom: Masinter.paSubject: Current issue statusto: CL-CLEANUP@Sail.Stanford.EDUcc: MasinterThis is my updated list of issue status. This is the list of issues distributed for the March 1988 X3J13 meeting:- ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT (Version 4, 23-Nov-87)  (Interaction of ADJUST-ARRAY and displaced arrays)- APPEND-DOTTED (Version 5, 14-Jan-88)  (What happens to CDR of last CONS?

The document is in TEX.	      Phase 1 involves rewriting the CLTL into the format that	      the X3J13 document will use.  Review involves verifying the	      correctness of the rewrite.  The final document for Phase 4	      is scheduled for June, 1989.  Kathy is looking for volunteers	      to suggest actual changes.10:00 am Item 6	 Character Subcommittee Report, Thom Linden	    A proposal should be ready for voting on at the next meeting.	      Bob Mathis noted that this topic was of great interest to many	      different ISO committees and that this was the right time to	      distribute our solution to the other committees.10:05 am Item 7	 Iteration Subcommittee Report, JonL White	    Of the three proposals, Loop is ready for voting and OSS and	      Generators need users.  Guy Steele asked for a straw vote on	      how many companies used some portion of Loops.  Approximately	      1/3 indicated that their companies did.10:45 am Morning Break11:10 am Item 7 (continued)	    Dick Waters presented OSS, its description and status.  The	      files are available to FTP.  Dick encouraged use and feedback.	      The copyright on OSS belongs only to Dick, not to MIT. The	      restriction on its use is that people will use it unchanged.	      If changes are made, the name of the system should be changed.	      Chris Perdue discussed the status of Generators.	The	      discussion focused on how complex proposals are to be included	      in CL: ie., as kernel features, as features within a hierarchical	      structure, or as optional features.  No resolution occured.12:30 pm Dick Waters raised some potential CL problems, and possible	      solutions, in the area of prettyprinting, particularly.12:35 pm Item 9, Lunch01:45 pm Item 10	 CLOS (88-002R, 88-003R), Gregor Kiczales	 Gregor described the responses to comments on the last version of	    CLOS, Chapters 1 and 2.  Detailed questions were raised and	    discussed.03:00 pm Afternoon Break03:15 pm Item 10 (continued)	    Discussion continued on remaining issues to be resolved and	      the form a resolution should make.  Gregor moved and David	      Moon seconded that:	      The X3J13 Committee hereby votes to accept Chapters 1 and 2 of	      the Common Lisp Object System, as defined in document 88-002R, for	      inclusion in the Common Lisp language being specified by this	      committee. Subsequent substative and wording changes will be	      handled with the usual editorial and cleanup process.	    Jim Antonio (who?) moved and JonL seconded an amendment to strike	      the second sentence. The motion was defeated 9-12.	    Dick Gabriel moved, and Larry Masinter seconded, to change the	      motion to the following:	      The X3J13 Committee hereby accepts chapters 1 and 2	      of the Common Lisp Object System, as defined in document	      88-002R, for inclusion in the Common Lisp language being	      specified by this committee. Subsequent changes will be handled	      through the usual editorial and cleanup processes.	      The motion passed 22-0.	    The original motion, as amended, passed 24-1.	    Guy Steele stated the appreciation of himself and the committee	      for the work of the CLOS subcommittee.04:55 pm Ending remarks	 Bob Mathis encouraged people to join relevant subcommittees.  Larry	   Masinter gave an overview to the Cleanup status that will be the	   topic of the agenda tomorrow.05:05 pm Item 11  Meeting adjournedThursday, June 1609:10 am  Item 12   Item 12   Call to Order. Bob Mathis	     Attendance at the ISO meeting at Sunbird is limited to people	       appointed by the committee.  The present attendees are planned	       to be Bob Mathis, Dick Gabriel, Kathy Chapman, Patrick Dussud,	       and one person from the Scheme standardization effort.	     David Bartley discussed IEEE Scheme Standardization meeting.  Will	       Clinger and someone else (who?) will be co-chairs.	     Macro Subcommittee	       Members of the subcommittee will be contacted by Bob Mathis to	       find out status and intentions.	     CLOS Subcommittee	       Dick Gabriel announced that chapters 1 and 2 will be published	       in SIGPLAN Notices and Lisp Journal and made available in such a	       way as to allow republication by any vendor.	     Error Subcommittee	       Kent Pittman distributed a document describing what would	       happen if an error were signalled.  Gregor moved, and	       Dick Gabriel seconded, that:	       The X3J13 committee hereby accepts revision 18 of the Common	       Lisp Condition System, as defined in document 88-005, for	       inclusion in the Common Lisp language being specified by this	       committee.  Subsequent changes will be handled through the	       usual editorial and cleanup processes.  These changes will	       include any necessary to reconcile the proposal with CLOS.	       Bob Mathis called for a straw vote asking whether the second	       sentence should be included in the motion.  The straw vote	       passed.	Bob Mathis called for a straw vote asking whether	       the third sentence should be included.  The straw vote passed	       13-11.	       The motion was voted and passed unanimously.  The committee	       applauded Kent Pittman's work.  Guy Steele moved, and JonL	       White seconded, a vote of appreciation for Kent's efforts.	       This motion also passed unanimously.	     Compiler Cleanup Subcommittee	       Sandra Loosemore discussed three proposals which had been	       distributed yesterday.  She encouraged comments to be sent	       to the subcommittee by August 1st to:			   CL-COMPILER@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU	       Volunteers were asked to contact Sandra Loosemore or Steve	       Haflich.  Bob Mathis noted that the X3J13 committee was expecting	       an overview of the issues and specific proposals to be	       distributed in time to allow a vote at the October meeting.	     Editorial Subcommittee	       Kathy Chapman suggested that a member of each subcommittee	       whose work is voted into CL should migrate first to the	       Cleanup Subcommittee and then to the Editorial Subcommittee.	       Kathy also suggested that each subcommittee should be	       represented in the Editorial Subcommittee.  There will be a	       meeting of the Editorial Subcommittee during lunch.10:40 am  Morning Break11:00 am  Item 8   Item 8, Definition Specs Proposal, JonL White	     JonL White repeated the Palo Alto proposal.  The ensuing	       discussion brought out the need for a written version of	       the proposal that addresses implementation costs.  It was	       hoped that a written version would be available in advance	       of the October meeting.11:30 am  Item 13   Item 13  Cleanup, Larry Masinter	     Larry presented a status report showing that of the 21 issues	       now under consideration, only three are still in "draft"	       form.  It is expected that a final vote will be taken in	       October on currently known issues.  The work after October	       would then focus on ambiguities noted by the Editorial	       Subcommittee and problems encountered with language areas	       added to CL.	     Larry Masinter moved, and JonL White seconded, that	       FUNCTION-TYPE-REST-LIST-ELEMENT be added to the language.	       Jeff moved, and Beckerly seconded, that the function	       will be tabled until the next meeting.  The motion to table	       passed.	     Larry Masinter moved, and JonL White seconded, that	       FUNCTION-TYPE be added to the language.12:30 pm Item 14 Lunch01:20 pm Item 13 (continued)	     Discussion centered on the automatic coercion of lambda	       expressions.  JonL White moved, and Gregor seconded, to	       Change Section 2e		 Clarify FUNCALL and APPLY and all CL functions that take		 function arguments to also take a symbol, which will be		 coerced to a function as with SYMBOL-FUNCTION.	       Change Section 6b		 (COERCE x 'FUNCTION), where the value of x is a list that		 begins with LAMBDA, will return a FUNCTION similar to		 (EVAL '(FUNCTION ,x)).	       Mike Beckerley moved, and JonL seconded, to amend the amendment		 to eliminate the word "clarify" from 2e and to replace		 "similar to"  with "as if by".02:30 pm Afternoon break02:40 pm Item 13 (continued)	       David Moon moved, and David Slater seconded, to amend the		  motion on the floor to	       Add Section 2f:		 FUNCALL and APPLY and all CL functions that take function		 arguments also take a list whose car is LAMBDA, which will		 be coerced to a function as if by		 (EVAL '(FUNCTION ,x))	       The amended motion failed 9-13.	       A move to call off debate was called.  The motion failed 8-12.	       Steve Haflich moved, and Chris Perdue seconded to	       Add Section 2f:		 This is an incompatible change, in that FUNCALL, APPLY, and	       all CL functions that take function arguments are not	       required to take a list beginning with LAMBDA.	       Barry Margolin moved, and Steve Haflich seconded, a friendly	       amendment to Steve's amendment to	       Add Section 2f:	       This is an incompatible change in that it is an error to pass	       anything other than a function or symbol as the function	       The motion to amend the amendment passed 21-0.	       The amendment to the cleanup proposal passed 20-1.	       David Moon moved, and Barry Margolin seconded, to cut off	       debate.	The movement passed 17-4.	       Jeff Dalton moved, and David Slater seconded, to table the	       amended motion.	The motion to table failed 6-13.	       The chair announced that if 5 people believe the issue should	       be sent to a mail ballot, it will be. No one challenged this	       decision.  Five people did not vote for a mail ballot.	       The amended motion, FUNCTION-TYPE, passed 16-7.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Guy Steele seconded, to add		 SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO to the language.	       Following discussion and acquiring of a volunteer to help,	       Larry Masinter moved to table the motion.  The	       tabling motion passed 15-6.	       The discussion then moved on to the 18 new proposals.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Sandra Loosemore seconded, to add	       ADJUST-ARRAY-FILL-POINTER to the language.  The motion passed	       unanimously.	       Larry Masinter moved, and xx seconded, to add	       DATA-TYPES-HIERARCHY-UNDERSPECIFIED to the language.	       Discussion noted that this is an incompatible change to	       existing implementations, although the representatives of the	       implementations felt this was a positive change.	       Guy Steele moved, and Dan Pierson seconded, to change the	       wording of the proposal as follows:	       "explicitly forbid" to be replaced by "it is an error for"	       The amendment passed unanimously.	       The amended proposal passed unanimously.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Dan Pierson seconded, to add	       DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NAME to the language.  Discussion	       on this was delayed.	       Barry Margolin moved, and Steve Haflich seconded, to add	       DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NUMBER to the language.  The	       motion passed unanimously.	       The motion to add DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NAME was tabled	       by general consent.	       The discussion of DEFSTRUCT-DEFAULT-VALUE-EVALUATION led to	       no resolution of opinion so it was decided not to bring the	       proposal to a motion.	       The discussion of EVAL-OTHER led to no resolution of opinion	       so it was decided not to bring the proposal to a motion.	       The discussion of FUNCTION-CALL-EVALUATION-ORDER led to no	       resolution so it was decided not to bring the proposal to a	       motion.	       Dan Pierson moved,and Barry Margolin seconded, to add LAST,	       with an argument, to the language.  The motion passed 16-3.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Dan Pierson seconded, to add	       MACRO-FUNCTION-ENVIRONMENT to the language.  The motion passed	       unanimously.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Barry Margolin seconded, to add	       SHARPSIGN-PLUS-MINUS-NUMBEr to the language.  The motion	       moved was the proposal with the phrase "list of symbols and/or	       numbers" changed to "list of symbols and/or integers".	       The motion failed 7-10.	       The discussion of SPECIAL-VARIABLE-TEST led to no resolution	       of opinion so it was decided not to bring the proposal to a	       motion.	       The discussion of STEP-ENVIRONMENT led to no resolution of	       opinion so it was decided not to bring the proposal to a	       motion.	       Larry Masinter moved, and Dan Pierson seconded, to add	       SUBSEQ-OUT-OF-BOUNDS to the language.  The motion passed	       unanimously.	       The discussion of WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING-APPEND-STYLE led to	       no resolution of opinion so it was decided not to bring the	       proposal to a motion.	       Larry brought up a list of issues which are currently under	       discussion.05:05 pm Closing Comments	  Jim Allard will talk to Bob Mathis about starting a working group on	  delivery issues.	  Dan Pierson offered to work with Barry Margolin on a position	  paper on how implementations have to deal with the standard.	  Bob Mathis emphasized that the October meeting would be a wrapup	  of many technical issues.  January will be a joint meeting with	  ISO.	The Palo Alto meeting will be a review of full document so	  that at the following meeting we have the goal of having a document	  which can be made public.05:20 pm Item 16 AdjournmentMinutes submitted by Mary S.

While Franz handles case sensitivity with a global parameter (or is it a global state), we made it a property of the read table; that is, the readtable could be a case sensitive or case insensitive readtable. This preserved the property that *READTABLE* captured the variations in the behavior of READ. It has not been a formal cleanup issue; if you want to write one up, READ-CASE-SENSITIVITY is a good name for it.As for READ-INTERNAL-CASE, its less clear to me what the problem is -- you mention embarrassment, but that seems to depend too much on the perspective of the viewer. Are you embarrassed by parentheses? By names like FMAKUNBOUND or CADADR? I think we withdrew PROCLAIM-LEXICAL because we couldn't figure out how to procede. If you like, I can send you the back-mail on the issue if you want to see if you can make some progress.HASH-TABLE-ENTRY-EXTENT: I was expecting that the discussion on Common Lisp would wind up as a cleanup proposal. Sounds like a good idea. Will you?Re Symbol-macro-flet: I'm just not convinced of the utility. At least the compilers I am familiar with go to some lengths to optimize uses of FLET and LABELS; having another binding mechanism doesn't seem like a step forward.

We have made other minor and majorincompatible changes to Common Lisp and will probably make more beforewe're done. We need a general way of dealing with features that are omittedand incompatible changes, and the steps you've outlined are reasonable.Maybe I've said this before, but  I think as far as cleanup is concernedour major question is: does this make the language enough "better" to beworth the cost. "Better" is not evaluated in isolation: while "cleaner" and"easier to understand"  are good properties of a programming language, alanguage is also "better" if there already exist a lot of programs writtenin it, if there already exist textbooks that teach it. If we make too many changes to the point where old programs can no longerbe made to work or if the old textbooks no longer apply. Each of us may have different way of combining these orthogonal goals of"better": folks differ on the importance of compatibility with existingprograms, on the value of simplicity over power and expressiveness.In the specific case of TEST-NOT-IF-NOT, I think that it makes the languageenough better along the dimensions of cleanliness, and has little impact onbackward compatibility.One aspect of "better" that seems to be of concern to the community yet wedon't address in the cleanup "issue form" is the impact on performance.Does this make the language more or less easy to implement efficiently. I'mthinking about adding a "Performance Impact" to the cleanup form, since itseems to be an undercurrent in a lot of the discussions.What do you think?*start*01412 00024 US Return-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM ([128.81.41.144]) by Xerox.COM ; 03 OCT 88 13:20:58 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 469639; Mon 3-Oct-88 16:21:10 EDTDate: Mon, 3 Oct 88 16:21 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Deprecation, cleanup goals, performanceTo: Masinter.PAcc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EDU, pierson%mist@Multimax.Encore.COMIn-Reply-To: <881003-122939-1139@Xerox>Message-ID: <881003162151.2.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>I agree with Masinter's comments about separating the goal and themechanism.When it does come to talking about mechanisms, though, it's wise tokeep in mind that unlike probably all other languages which provide thesedeprecated features, Lisp has meta-level primitives capable of "noticing"the changes in a way that affects programs. By this I mean that since namesin the language are first class structures (ie, symbols), deprecation comesat no small cost. I don't think it's wise for us to think of phasing out asymbol on the Lisp package partly because removing it will lead to allkinds of confusion with packages using other packages that may or may nothave the symbol (depending on the implementation), problems with print/readof symbols across systems, etc.*start*04695 00024 US Return-Path: <ROSENKING@A.ISI.EDU>Received: from A.ISI.EDU ([26.3.0.103]) by Xerox.COM ; 05 OCT 88 13:45:58 PDTDate: 5 Oct 88 16:44 EDTSender: ROSENKING@A.ISI.EDUSubject: Potential Clean-Up IssuesFrom: ROSENKING@A.ISI.EDUTo: masinter.paMessage-ID: <[A.ISI.EDU] 5-Oct-88 16:44:31.ROSENKING>COMMENTS ON THE DRAFT PROPOSED AMERICAN NATIONAL STANDARDFOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS - PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE COMMON LISPChapters reviewed: Macros, StreamsSubmitted by: Jeffrey P. Rosenking, 5 October 1988********************************************************************The following are some potential clean up issues which I haveuncovered during my editing of the MACRO and STREAM chapters.I was unsure how to present them to you, so I am using thesame format that I used for presenting comments to Kathy. Arethese clean up issues which you have seen before ? Do you wantthem in the clean up issue format ? Let me know what you think.         Thanks,           Jeff** POSSIBLE CLEAN-UP ISSUE **The example for make-concatenated-stream works as documented when it  is run on the Macintosh under Allegro Common Lisp. BUT, when this  same example is run on the Symbolics it returns the value 1. Running  several other examples shows that the Symbolics implementation will  only return the value from the first stream.** POSSIBLE CLEAN-UP ISSUE **The example for input-stream-p, on page 6-36, does not work the same  on all implementations. The last example should be modified to :  (input-stream-p (make-string-output-stream)) --> NILThe above expression returns the same value, NIL, when executed on  both the Mac and the Symbolics. When (make-brpadcast-stream) is in  the expression input-stream-p returns NIL on the Mac and T on the  Symbolics. Another clean-up issue.** POSSIBLE CLEAN-UP ISSUE **The example for output-stream-p, on page 6-37, does not work the same  on all implementations. The last example should be modified to :  (output-stream-p (make-string-input-stream "jr")) --> NIL  The above expression returns the same value, NIL, when executed on  both the Mac and the Symbolics. When (make-concatenated-stream) is  used in the expression output-stream-p returns NIL on the Mac and  T on the Symbolics. Yet another clean-up issue.** POSSIBLE CLEAN-UP ISSUES **The examples for stream-element-type are full of inconsistencies !  The first expression, (stream-element-type *debug-io*) returns the  value STRING-CHAR when executed on the Mac, but when executed on  the Symbolics it returns the value CHARACTER. STRING-CHAR is aUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU}  subtype of CHARACTER. The same results are returned by each of the  computers when *standard-input* and *terminal-io* are substituted  for *debug-io*.  The second expression, (stream-element-type (make-concatenated-stream)),  returns the value T when executed on the Symbolics but it returns the  value STRING-CHAR when executed on the Mac.  The third expression (setq s ...) should have an additional keyword  and value included in the expression, namely the :direction keyword  with the :output value. This is needed on the Symbolics where the  default :direction value is :input. The Macs defalut is output.  The fourth expression, (stream-element-type s), also retruns different  values on the Mac and on the Symbolics. The Mac returns the value BIT  for this expression, and the Symbolics returns (UNSIGNED-BYTE 16),  after the :direction modification has been made.In the example for close, in STREAMs on page 6-40,  the second expression, (close s), can evaluate to several values  - within the same implementation - based on the type of stream.  A stream created with the open function will normally return the  stream name (in #<stream> format) when it is originally closed.  Each additional request to close an already closed stream, of this  type, will cause NIL to be returned. If the stream is a broadcast or  concatenated type stream then calling close on it will cause T to be  returned, if this is the first close request. Each subsequent close  request will cause an error of type unbound variable, even though the  variable still evaluates to a stream at top level. All of the above  is true on the Mac Allegro Lisp implementation. On the Symbolics,  repeated calls of close on a stream causes nil to be returned.  Proposed solution: I would recommend that close return the stream  name, at all times, of the form #<stream>.********************************************************************"Always remember, no matter where you go, there you are!"                 - Buckaroo Bonzai*start*01023 00024 US Date:  6 Oct 88 10:09 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: several hundred ugly things In-reply-to: Scott.Fahlman@B.GP.CS.CMU.EDU's message of Thu, 06 Oct 88 11:24:02 EDTTo: Scott.Fahlman@B.GP.CS.CMU.EDUcc: masinter.pa, CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUScott:There's some desire in some parts of ISO to make Common Lisp "smaller".

You develop your program using whatever parts of the full        language you need, then compile in a way that trims away anything that        wasn't used.  This creates a subset of Common Lisp that exactly fits the        needs of the application in question.  A simple version of this is trivial        to implement in any system that has a copying GC; ...        If only that were true.  For example, a routine that uses + implicitly    uses bignums and complex numbers, plus ERROR to handle problems like    (+ 'a '(foo)).  Bignums require GC.  ERROR uses FORMAT, READ, and    EVAL.  FORMAT uses..., and pretty soon you've got the kitchen sink    again.    Well, in addition to just depending on the GC, you probably also want togive the user some way of declaring that his application doesn't usecertain features such as bignums, complexes, floating point, the errorsystem (just terminate instead), circular printing, or whatever.  The pointI'm trying to make is that you shouldn't try to impose a single subset oneveryone, but should allow each user to select the subset he needs.-- Scott*start*11454 00024 US Date:  7 Oct 88 23:49 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Issue Status (finally!!)To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.educc: masinterWith much help from Kent, I've managed to make it through the list of issues, mailing out the ones that looked like they were ready.Tomorrow, I will go through, make sure I have hardcopy of all of the released issues, look for ones that look like they should be released (in DRAFT form, if necessary) to X3J13.

We've tried for most ofthe issues to at least summarize the discussion, but perhaps we've beenamiss, or have missed some points. You're welcome to participate directlyin the cleanup committee, of course.I promise all of you that if you send comments on issues to cl-cleanup thatthey will not be ignored, and that I think it is important that you aresatisfied that your concerns have at least been aired before a proposal isvoted on in the full X3J13 meeting.Thanks,Larry*start*04039 00024 US Return-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM ([128.81.41.144]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 OCT 88 02:01:41 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 473543; Sun 9-Oct-88 05:01:50 EDTDate: Sun, 9 Oct 88 05:01 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Deadline for new issuesTo: Masinter.PAcc: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMMessage-ID: <881009050130.7.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>I know we're about to close the doors to new issues. Due to the overwhelmingabout of work being done on existing issues, I have not gotten through mylist of pending issues that need to be opened. I went through the file andthrew out things that were obviously unreasonable to bother with at thispoint but several issues remained. I realize that as time goes on, it willbe increasingly difficult to consider major changes -- I'm willing to havethese issues considered on their merits weighed against the time when theyare submitted -- but I just don't want someone to out of hand claim thatthe floor was closed and that I can't raise these issues at all, regardlessof merit...IN-SYNTAX (this might be handled by Compiler committee)   Need an IN-SYNTAX to match IN-PACKAGE? There is no way to set   *READTABLE* locally within a file. Without this, customizable   readtables are not very useful.   Imagined example:     (IN-PACKAGE 'INTERLISP)     (IN-SYNTAX IL:*WINNING-SYNTAX*)     [DEFUN ...]STANDARD-VALUES (this might be handled by Errors committee)   Need a way to specify variables that should be rebound when   entering the debugger. This would include:         DEFVAR-STANDARD-VALUE         LET-STANDARD-VALUE         STANDARD-VALUE, (SETF STANDARD-VALUE)   LET and SETQ would still work on standard value variables,   but would not affect the standard value. Hence,         (DEFVAR-STANDARD-VALUE *PACKAGE* (FIND-PACKAGE "USER"))         (LET ((*PACKAGE* (FIND-PACKAGE "JOE"))	   (ERROR "Zowie"))	 would rebind *PACKAGE* to package USER in debugger, but         (LET-STANDARD-VALUE ((*PACKAGE* (FIND-PACKAGE "JOE"))	   (ERROR "Zowie"))         would leave *PACKAGE* set to package JOE in debugger.USER-DEFINED-STREAMS   Need a way to define user-defined streams. It may not be   feasible to do this in time, but we should stay open to the   possibility because it's needed for portable window systems.COMPILE-AND-LOAD-VERBOSITY (this might be handled by Compiler committee)   Need to clarify how much typeout is done when :VERBOSE is specified   to :COMPILE and :LOAD. Some implementations think it means to type    Loading (or Compiling) xxx.lisp   while others think it means to show all the details function-by-function.   This should be consistent across implementations.BACKQUOTE-PORTABILITY	   Backquote is not consistent across implementations. This is a   portability barrier to no good end -- there is no efficiency gain   to be had from being non-specific.   Sample screw case in some implementations, but not in others:     `(... ,@x) problems. eg,       (SETQ FOO (CONS NIL NIL))       (SETQ BAR `(A B ,@FOO))       (SETF (CAR FOO) 'C)       FOO  (C)       BAR  (A B NIL) ;should be (A B C)PATHNAME-PRINT-READ   Extend syntax to include a #P printed representation of pathnames   in order to hide uninteresting or misleading representational details,   not to mention make things more concise.   eg, #P"S:>kmp>foo.lisp"PACKAGE-FUNCTION-CONSISTENCY   Do functions like INTERN take strings as their second arguments?   Implementations are not consistent.ENVIRONMENT-ENQUIRY   The environment inquiry functions (pp447-448) don't return a   value in consistent format across implementations. This makes   them virtually useless. I would like to constrain the values   enough so that implementors knew what to provide as return   values, and provide some examples of intended uses.*start*04054 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 11 OCT 88 10:59:05 PDTReceived: from NSS.Cs.Ucl.AC.UK by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 11 Oct 88  10:40:49 PDTReceived: from aiai.edinburgh.ac.uk by NSS.Cs.Ucl.AC.UK   via Janet with NIFTP           id aa03324; 9 Oct 88 18:07 BSTDate: Sun, 9 Oct 88 18:06:33 BSTMessage-Id: <8809.8810091706@subnode.aiai.ed.ac.uk>From: Jeff Dalton <jeff%aiai.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSS.Cs.Ucl.AC.UK>Subject: Re: several hundred ugly things To: Scott.Fahlman@b.gp.cs.cmu.edu, masinter.paIn-Reply-To: Scott.Fahlman@edu.cmu.cs.gp.b's message of Thu, 06 Oct 88 20:51:36 EDTCc: CL-Cleanup@sail.stanford.eduL.Masinter:   There's some desire in some parts of ISO to make Common Lisp   "smaller".

This is what I have in my notes and if I'vegot something confused, feel free to speak up and correct me.Issues COMPILE-FILE-HANDLING-OF-TOP-LEVEL-FORMS,EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL, and DEFINING-MACROS-NON-TOP-LEVEL were tabledin order to allow time to prepare new proposals.  If new proposalsdon't materialize in time for voting at the next meeting, we will voteon the existing proposals then. Issues COMPILE-ARGUMENT-PROBLEMS (with amendment), COMPILE-FILE-PACKAGE(with wording change suggested by Pitman), OPTIMIZE-DEBUG-INFO, andPROCLAIM-INLINE-WHERE (with wording change suggested by Slater) werevoted on and accepted.Two polls were taken on things relating to outstanding issues.  Thefirst indicated substantial opposition and very little support fordoing anything that would require interpreters to do macroexpansionand other kinds of syntactic processing in a prepass before doing theactual evaluation.  Pitman wanted it pointed out that this reflectedpeople's (possibly) uninformed opinion, however.The second poll was on the various options for issue LOAD-TIME-EVAL.  I'mgoing to address this issue in more detail in a separate message, buthere are the results of the voting.option				like	hate----------------------------------------------remove #, completely		14	8new special form		19	4quoted magic token		6	13do nothing			1	19I would like to put as many of the remaining issues as we can on amail ballot in December.  To do so, the latest we can accept commentsand requests for revisions on those issues is mid-November -- that is,about a month from now.  I'm going to have to assume that if people onthe compiler committee don't submit their comments in a timely manner,that implies approval of the way things are going. Other specific people I have marked down as doing specific things:  Pierson, Haflich, Barrett, and Perdue indicated they would try  to prepare new proposals on the three issues that were tabled.  I  am expecting that they will either distribute draft versions or give  up within the next month.  JonL volunteered to help figure out what compiler support is needed  by CLOS.   Dan Pierson and I are working on the compiler warnings issue.  The cleanup committee has two issues open that deal with the special  compiler handling of package functions; I will ask Masinter to keep us  informed on what happens with them.-Sandra-------*start*01437 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 13 OCT 88 11:47:14 PDTReceived: from cs.utah.edu by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 13 Oct 88  11:47:30 PDTReceived: by cs.utah.edu (5.54/utah-2.0-cs)	id AA15286; Thu, 13 Oct 88 12:45:49 MDTReceived: by defun.utah.edu (5.54/utah-2.0-leaf)	id AA19784; Thu, 13 Oct 88 12:45:46 MDTFrom: sandra%defun@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Message-Id: <8810131845.AA19784@defun.utah.edu>Date: Thu, 13 Oct 88 12:45:45 MDTSubject: oopsTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduSorry, that last message slipped out prematurely before I'd finishedediting it.

I think of aesthetic considerations as strongly relatedto the properties of elegance, ease of teaching, learning andunderstanding. I tend to enjoy using computer systems that areaesthetically pleasing. Personally, I reached the conclusion long ago that it would not be possibleto make major inroads into the aesthetics of Common Lisp by any small setof "cleanups". What makes Common Lisp hard to teach and learn is notnecessarily even caused by a lack of elegance or simplicity. There is someevidence that Scheme is hard to teach and learn, although this has beenmitigated by the excellent effort that has gone into teaching materials forit.I think I will claim that I was misquoted in my reference to ISO --although perhaps I merely mispoke. I think there is much interest indefining a language that is smaller than Common Lisp, e.g., that works wellwith the current and pending generations of laptops and PCs.  While I heardthis interest most recently expressed at an ISO meeting, it is of seriousconcern in the US as well, e.g., by those considering Lisp for applicationsin embedded systems. However, on reflection, I believe that the issues of determining thosefeatures of CL that should be declared "obsolete" is nearly orthogonal tothe issues of "delivery subsets" or some such. I think we can define aclass of features of CL that should be Obsolete. How these are to be dealtwith in any implementation is an important concern, but will be easier todetermine once we have the list of "obsolete" features. (I would include:TEST-NOT and BIGNUM and STRING-CHAR and some other misfeatures into the"obsolete" bucket; perhaps you have your own list.)*start*01272 00024 USaReturn-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM ([128.81.41.144]) by Xerox.COM ; 17 OCT 88 12:19:01 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 477485; Mon 17-Oct-88 15:19:15 EDTDate: Mon, 17 Oct 88 15:18 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Upcoming letter ballotTo: Masinter.PAcc: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMMessage-ID: <881017151859.8.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>I suggest we permit contingent votes on the upcoming letter ballot.My feeling is that we are unlikely to encounter circularities and thatwe should just allow the contingencies expressed by people to colorthe order of our ballot tabulation.

Larry Masinter and Gregor Kiczales; Danny Bobrow also came for the October 11 presentation.Progress is being made for producing a draft standard in mid-1989. Subcommittees reporting include:Characters: The character subcommittee was to address the issues surrounding support for international character sets. Their draft proposal prompted a number of criticisms (including some from the authors) and is being revised. Our major concern right now is that the current proposal adds too much mechanism, although the mechanism is currently compatible with Xerox character encoding.Objects: the Common Lisp object system, accepted at the last X3J13 meeting, is in no small part the result of the contribution from Gregor Kiczales from Xerox, who not only worked on the standard but also contributed a portable implementation that several Common Lisp vendors are adopting. At this meeting, Danny Bobrow reported on the CLOS workshop held at PARC in early October, and Gregor gave an overview of the meta-object protocol. Cleanup: the cleanup committee reported on over 100 proposals to change the language  in a marathon 7-hour session; the goal is to close the door on proposals for change except as requested by other subcommittees by the January meeting.Compiler: the compiler committee has several "cleanup" style issues inder consideration, but not much luck in designing a compilation model.Signal/Condition: version 18 of the signal condition proposal was adopted in the June X31j3 meeting. However, there were a few items now being treated as "cleanup" to version 18 that were discussed.Editorial: The editor has devised a new format for the standard, the editorial committee voted to accept the new format, the standard reviewers are to insure that descriptions of functions and variables and macros conform to the new format.

Larry Masinter and Gregor Kiczales; Danny Bobrow also came for the October 11 presentation.Progress is being made for producing a draft standard in mid-1989. Subcommittees reporting include:Characters: The character subcommittee was to address the issues surrounding support for international character sets. Their draft proposal prompted a number of criticisms (including some from the authors) and is being revised. Our major concern right now is that the current proposal adds too much mechanism, although the mechanism is currently compatible with Xerox character encoding.Objects: the Common Lisp object system, accepted at the last X3J13 meeting, is in no small part the result of the contribution from Gregor Kiczales from Xerox, who not only worked on the standard but also contributed a portable implementation that several Common Lisp vendors are adopting. At this meeting, Danny Bobrow reported on the CLOS workshop held at PARC in early October, and Gregor gave an overview of the meta-object protocol. Cleanup: the cleanup committee reported on over 100 proposals to change the language  in a marathon 7-hour session; the goal is to close the door on proposals for change except as requested by other subcommittees by the January meeting.Compiler: the compiler committee has several "cleanup" style issues inder consideration, but not much luck in designing a compilation model.Signal/Condition: version 18 of the signal condition proposal was adopted in the June X31j3 meeting. However, there were a few items now being treated as "cleanup" to version 18 that were discussed.Editorial: The editor has devised a new format for the standard, the editorial committee voted to accept the new format, the standard reviewers are to insure that descriptions of functions and variables and macros conform to the new format. There is a creditable schedule for producing a draft. Various individuals have volunteered to review/edit sections of the Standard before submitting the draft to ANSI.Larry*start*03911 00024 USaReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 25 OCT 88 09:09:03 PDTMessage-ID: <$7Wc0@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Date: 25 Oct 88 08:52 PDTFrom: Dick Gabriel <RPG@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Subject: Proposed US Position Statement To: x3j13@SAIL.Stanford.EDU The following is my proposed US position statement for ISO:*********************************************************************The US is currently supporting two standardization efforts in Lisp:X3J13 is standardizing Common Lisp for ANSI, and IEEE is standardizingScheme. The US believes that these two efforts cover a wide range ofconcerns and uses for Lisp: Scheme is small, elegant, andmathematically well-founded, and Common Lisp is full-featured, mature,and commercially viable. Therefore, the US sees no need at this timeto standardize another dialect of Lisp for use within the US. Itfollows that the primary activity of WG16 is not of major importancewithin the US.Nevertheless, it appears that WG16 is planning to provide a usefulstandard for Europe. For this reason, WG16 is currently defining adialect of Lisp called ``ISLISP'' suitable for the needs of the Europeancommunity. The US is happy to aid that process.Common Lisp and Scheme are beginning to enjoy widespread use not onlyin the US but internationally. The charter for WG16 that wasdetermined at its first meeting in February 1988 allows forstandardization of multiple dialects of Lisp. Therefore, the US wishesfor WG16 to propose to ISO a standard for ISO Common Lisp, to becalled ``ISO Common Lisp.'' As ISLISP is aimed at satisfying certainneeds for a certain community, so ISO Common Lisp would be aimed atsatisfying the Common Lisp needs for a certain community.  The USwishes to reserve the right to request that WG16 propose to ISO astandard for ISO Scheme.By making this request, the US does not intend to impede or negate thework of WG16 on ISLISP, just as we presume that the work of thecommittee on ISLISP is not intended to impede or negate the work ofX3J13 on Common Lisp or of IEEE on Scheme in the US.The community of Common Lisp users and implementors is internationalin nature: Common Lisp is in wide use in Europe, Japan, and Australia.Implementations of Common Lisp are under way in the UK, Germany,Italy, and Japan (and possibly other countries). ANSI is not aninternational standards organization, and so it is appropriate forWG16 to propose a standard for ISO Common Lisp to ISO. Furthermore, itis common for various US funding agencies to require projects to beundertaken in ISO languages when they are available. Just as it wouldbe unfair for Common Lisp to be imposed by law in contexts where it isnot wanted, so it would be unfair for ISLISP to be imposed within theUS. For this reason, it is important for ISO to adopt Common Lisp asan ISO standard language.Common Lisp has been under design and specification for 8 years.Commercial versions of Common Lisp have been available for 4 years.  Ithas been shown that small memory Common Lisp implementations arepossible and that small applications can be delivered. The key is inimplementation technology and not in language design. There are anumber of companies whose entire revenue depends on selling softwarewritten in Common Lisp. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agencyallows software to be written in Common Lisp (as well as Ada).The US feels that the most interesting task for WG16 is towards a nextgeneration dialect of Lisp, combining the best aspects of Common Lisp,Scheme, the Common Lisp Object System (now officially part of CommonLisp), and other interesting (possibly parallel) dialects of Lisp.The US believes that this task can begin once the needs of currentLisp programmers and implementors is satisfied with ISO ISLISP and ISOCommon Lisp.*start*01802 00024 US Return-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 25 OCT 88 14:22:56 PDTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 25 Oct 88  14:05:19 PDTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 25 OCT 88 13:50:39 PDTDate: 25 Oct 88 13:50 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Comments on Cleanup issues due within two weeksTo: X3J13@Sail.stanford.edureply-to: CL-Cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <881025-135039-11718@Xerox>As was discussed in the October X3J13 meeting, there will be a letterballot on the outstanding previously distributed cleanup issues.

If you feel it needs editing, Iwould also like to hear that.  If you would rather not sign it, I willnot be at all offended.----------------We would like to comment on your proposed US position statement for ISOWG16.  We agree with much of what you say in your statement. Critically,we agree that the U.S. must seek a change in the current ISO direction.But we feel that your statement does not make sufficiently clear thoseresponsibilities which lead the X3J13 committee to this position. X3J13is the committee we are most familiar with.  There is probably someoverlap between the concerns mentioned in this note and those of theIEEE Scheme effort.  But we have largely confined our attention to theX3J13 Common Lisp process.The X3J13 effort is quite mature.  We have almost finished the standardwe are chartered to develop.  Most technical decisions have been made,and the ones that remain to be made have already received significantdiscussion and study.  Editorial work to produce the standards documentis already well underway.A number of individuals and companies have devoted significant time andresources to creating the X3J13 Common Lisp standard.  An even largernumber of individuals, companies and government organizations havedevoted resources to preparing themselves to use this standard.  TheX3J13 committee has a significant committment to these individuals andcompanies; we must finish the language we set out to create, and we mustensure that it becomes an official standard.An important part of this committment is that we cannot at this pointtake any action which would diminish the value the standard we haveworked so hard to create.  This responsibility constrains our options inworking with the ISO standardization effort.  These constraints can becomplex and difficult to understand.  This accounts in part for the timeit has taken the U.S. delegation to develop this position statement.But one such constraint is now clear.  The X3J13 committee cannotendorse the development of an ISO standard which is similar butdifferent from ANSI Common Lisp.To do so would significantly weaken the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  Itcan be argued that problems which might result from policies whichmandate the use of ISO standards over ANSI standards could be resolved.But the resolution of those problems would take time.  It is preciselyto avoid those kinds of problems that our "constituency" has charteredus to develop ANSI Common Lisp.In addition, there would be widespread confusion among educators,authors, application vendors and others about which Common Lisp was the"more" standard one.  The technical leaders of the X3J13 effort would berightly criticized for not being committed to the language they created.The United States, is however part of the ISO Lisp standardizationprocess.  As part of that process we must decide how to resolve ourobligations to our X3J13 consituency with the obligations otherdelegations have to their constituency.  We would of course like to dothis in the most generous and equitable way possible.  At this point, itappears that the idea of multiple ISO standards is the best option.One of these ISO standards would be the language currently beingspecified by the X3J13 committee.  This could be called ISO Common Lisp.We would of course be willing to allow last minute cleanup proposals toensure that the language is in fact suitable for use as an internationalstandard.  It is a sign of our committment to this that we are assigninga high priority to the character set proposal.Other ISO Lisp standards could be developed for other specific purposes.Those standards would of course have to be sufficiently different fromISO Common Lisp that they would not diminish it.   It may be possible todevelop a reasonable subset of ISO Common Lisp, but we do not believe itis possible do so in a short timeframe.We understand, and we believe the entire X3J13 committee understands,that this position may be perceived as inflexible by certain othermembers of the ISO committee.  We would ask those members to considerthe committment we have to the individuals and companies which haveplans to use the language being specified by X3J13.  We simply cannottake an action which would compromise that committment.-------*start*01019 00024 US Date:  2 Nov 88 09:40 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: Friend of the Court BriefIn-reply-to: Gregor.pa's message of Tue, 1 Nov 88 20:16 PSTTo: Gregor.pacc: Moon@Stony-Brook.SCRC.Symbolics.com, GLS@Think.com, Fahlman@cs.cmu.edu, Scherlis@Vax.darpa.mil, CHaynes@iuvax.cd.indiana.edu, RPG@Sail.Stanford.edu, Masinter.PA, Bobrow.PAI would like to add something to the following effect (perhaps this can be said more briefly):Many of the items listed in "DRAFT REPORT OF THE SEECOND MEETING OF ISO/IEC JTC1/SC 22/WG 16 LISP", document number 26, are (a) not being directly addressed by X3J13 and (b) of great interest to many members of the US community.

This could be called ISO Common Lisp.    We would of course be willing to allow last minute cleanup proposals to    ensure that the language is in fact suitable for use as an international    standard.  It is a sign of our committment to this that we are assigning    a high priority to the character set proposal.I endorse the change proposed by Masinter.  We welcome cleanup proposalsnecessary for international use and acceptance.        Other ISO Lisp standards could be developed for other specific purposes.    Those standards would of course have to be sufficiently different from    ISO Common Lisp that they would not diminish it.   It may be possible to    develop a reasonable subset of ISO Common Lisp, but we do not believe it    is possible do so in a short timeframe.    We understand, and we believe the entire X3J13 committee understands,    that this position may be perceived as inflexible by certain other    members of the ISO committee.  We would ask those members to consider    the committment we have to the individuals and companies which have    plans to use the language being specified by X3J13.  We simply cannot    take an action which would compromise that committment.    I think "cannot" is a bit strong.  I'd say "We feel that it would be wrongfor us to compromise that commitment."  But I'll go along with "cannot" ifthe rest of you prefer it.Please run the result through spell.  I spotted some instances of"committment" and other minor glitches.-- Scott*start*00945 00024 US Return-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 07 NOV 88 06:50:47 PSTReceived: from A.ISI.EDU by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 7 Nov 88  06:38:55 PSTDate: 7 Nov 88 09:37 ESTSender: ROSENKING@A.ISI.EDUSubject: Re: Proposed US Position Statement From: ROSENKING@A.ISI.EDUTo: Gregor.paCc: x3j13@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <[A.ISI.EDU] 7-Nov-88 09:37:07.ROSENKING>In-Reply-To: <19881103000503.4.GREGOR@PORTNOY.parc.xerox.com>I wish to extend my support to the comments made by Bobrow et al, in reference to Dick Gabriel's Proposed US Position Statement.

The following the is current(and I presume the final) position statement:**************************************************************************The US is currently undertaking two standardization efforts in Lisp:X3J13 is standardizing Common Lisp for ANSI, and IEEE is standardizingScheme.  The US believes that these two efforts cover a wide range ofconcerns and uses for Lisp: Scheme is small, elegant, andmathematically well-founded, and Common Lisp is full-featured, mature,and commercially viable.  Within the United States, there is no demandfor another Lisp standard at this time. The current activity of WG16 is to develop a standard for a dialect ofLisp directed at a community of users who are served neither by CommonLisp nor by Scheme---that dialect is IsLisp.  Although IsLisp will notbe of major importance within the US, the US supports the IsLispstandardization effort as long as it does not negatively affectstandards for other dialects of Lisp.  In particular, the US feelsthat it is important not to have two standardized dialects of Lispthat are nearly identical unless one is a strict subset of the other.Having two such similar but different dialects weakens the position ofusers who have come to depend on one of the dialects.The US believes that the primary focus of standardization is to codifyexisting practice to support the creation and delivery of portablesoftware.  Thus, the major focus of the US standardization efforts isto provide stability to the community of Common Lisp and Scheme users.Of secondary importance are the invention of new Lisp dialects and thestandardization of Lisp dialects or features not in common usage.  TheUS therefore agrees with the ISO goal of a near term standard in the1990 time frame along with longer range consideration of futuredialects and features.Common Lisp is in wide use in Europe, Japan, and Australia.Implementations of Common Lisp are under way in the UK, Germany,Italy, and Japan (and possibly other countries).  In each of thesecountries there are companies whose customers depend on portablesoftware written in Common Lisp.  The future of these companiesthus depends on having a Common Lisp standard.  Furthermore, it iscommon for various US funding agencies to require projects to beundertaken in ISO languages when they are available.  Just as it wouldbe unfair for Common Lisp to be imposed by law in contexts where it isnot wanted, so it would be unfair for IsLisp to be imposed within theUS.For these reasons, the US proposes that WG16 produce a draft standardfor ISO Common Lisp.  As IsLisp is aimed at satisfying certain needsfor a specific community, so ISO Common Lisp would be aimed atsatisfying the Common Lisp needs for the international Common Lispcommunity.  The US wishes to reserve the right to request that WG16produce a draft standard for ISO Scheme.The US believes that Common Lisp is a valid candidate forinternational standardization both because it is used internationallyand also because it is a mature and stable dialect.  Common Lisp hasbeen under design and specification for 8 years.  Commercial qualityimplementations of Common Lisp have been available for 4 years.  Ithas been shown that small memory Common Lisp implementations arepossible and that small applications can be delivered: The key tosmall applications lies more in implementation technology and theenvironment than in language design.  The near term standardization ofISO Common Lisp would have substantial positive impact on theacceptance of existing commercial Lisp implementations and of allfuture Lisp dialects as vehicles for emerging applications.The US believes that WG16 is the appropriate working group tostandardize Common Lisp.  As determined at its first meeting, thecharter of WG16 endorses the standardization of multiple dialects ofLisp.  Therefore, WG16 can choose to produce draft standards for bothCommon Lisp and IsLisp.  It is not sufficient that there be only anANSI standard for Common Lisp because ANSI is not an internationalstandards organization.The US feels that a draft standard for ISO Common Lisp could beprepared by December 1989 with the assistance of X3J13.  The USproposes that WG16 request X3J13 to prepare the ISO draft standard forCommon Lisp.  The ISO Common Lisp draft and the ANSI Common Lisp draftshould be identical.Looking beyond Common Lisp, IsLisp, and Scheme, the US feels that animportant task for WG16 is working towards a next generation dialectof Lisp, and this can be accomplished by drawing on the lessons learnedfrom existing dialects of Lisp.*start*01389 00024 USaReturn-Path: <jonl@lucid.com>Received: from lucid.com ([192.26.25.1]) by Xerox.COM ; 07 NOV 88 21:14:45 PSTReceived: from bhopal ([192.9.200.13]) by heavens-gate.lucid.com id AA01349g; Mon, 7 Nov 88 21:14:03 PSTReceived: by bhopal id AA07860g; Mon, 7 Nov 88 21:12:43 PSTDate: Mon, 7 Nov 88 21:12:43 PSTFrom: Jon L White <jonl@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8811080512.AA07860@bhopal>To: Masinter.paCc: Gregor.pa, jonl@lucid.comSubject: Deadline for Cleanup IssuesI need more time to work on the several remaining issues that I'm acentral party to.

They implemented it using*only* CLtL as their source of information; that is, they did not rely onan existing implementation, such as Spice Lisp, or on being coupled intothe "old boy" network as a source of implementation folklore.  As a result,in many places where CLtL is ambiguous they made interpretations differentfrom those of other implementors.  These differing interpretations havebeen invaluable to the ANSI X3J13 process of "debugging" CLtL.  They havealso made it perhaps more difficult to port code between KCL and otherCommon Lisp implementations, but I do not know offhand of a case where thishas been KCL's fault, rather than a fault of impreciseness in CLtL.Does this help?--Guy*start*00796 00024 USaReturn-Path: <@REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU:Mly@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>Received: from REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU ([128.52.22.53]) by Xerox.COM ; 23 NOV 88 12:20:30 PSTReceived: from PERON.AI.MIT.EDU by REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 151452; Wed 23-Nov-88 15:18:56 ESTDate: Wed, 23 Nov 88 15:28 ESTFrom: Richard Mlynarik <Mly@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>Subject: condition-system criticismsTo: Masinter.paMessage-ID: <19881123202827.8.MLY@PERON.AI.MIT.EDU>So did you have any comments on the comments I made?I can understand not having had enough time to even think about it,though...In particular, do you think I have been diplomatic enough?

To get on an official list ofendorsed, official ADA implementations, you have to run a bunch oftests that are supplied by the ADA office.  These are easy tests topass because you get to run them yourself.  The neat thing is thatperiodically, new test suites are announced and you have to be able torun them too to stay on the list.

Not really disgruntled with your decision -- which is probably forthe best since my guess is that it would fail if voted on now -- but ratherdisgruntled with people's ability to put aside their personal biases andjust decide on something reasonable. The issue seems swamped only due tothe choice of upper vs lower case. I have given what I feel are compellingarguments for why I think upper case is appropriate both in the abstractand also for reasons of internal linguistic consistency. And I use lowercasepathnames all the time. The only objections I've heard are "oh, I never triedthat but surely it must be too hard". I find this kind of uncooperativenessto be very daunting.I don't mind cases where I've worked hard on something like COERCE-INCOMPLETEand Moon comes along and says "throw it out the window" because he has verydefensible technical grounds for saying so. I might even follow up on thatsuggestion. It's these cases where people are letting little personal biasesget in the way of important technical progress that really bug me.Anyway, trying to take a positive tone, ... How about if you and I agreeto just leave the whole space of PATHNAME-xxx issues aside. My time ispretty occupied with other things anyway, and it would be a usefulsimplification to my scheduling algorithm to know that I didn't have tolook at these until after the letter ballot (and a few other things,like the latest review draft I owe back to Kathy) are out of the way. Doyou have any problem with saying now that the whole set of pathname issueswill not go into the letter ballot? If you have some you think are verylikely to pass and you want to get out of the way, I can certainly dealwith some known subset being postponed.

I am sendingthis now for several reasons. First, because it is fresh in my mind.Second, because the events are a little more dramatic than usual.Third, because one outcome was the cancellation of the January ISOmeeting in Hawaii.The US Delegation consisted of Bob Mathis, Thom Linden, PatrickDussud, Gregor Kiczales, and myself. The meeting was held at theBuilding of the European Community in Brussels, Belgium. It was heldMonday and Tuesday, November 21 and 22.Attending were France, The Netherlands, Germany, Japan, the UK, andthe US.The US presented its position statement, which is as follows:************************************************************************The US is currently undertaking two standardization efforts in Lisp:X3J13 is standardizing Common Lisp for ANSI, and IEEE is standardizingScheme.  The US believes that these two efforts cover a wide range ofconcerns and uses for Lisp: Scheme is small, elegant, andmathematically well-founded, and Common Lisp is full-featured, mature,and commercially viable.  Within the United States, there is no demandfor another Lisp standard at this time. The current activity of WG16 is to develop a standard for a dialect ofLisp directed at a community of users who are served neither by CommonLisp nor by Scheme---that dialect is IsLisp.  Although is is unlikelythat IsLisp will have major near term commercial significance withinthe US, the US supports the IsLisp standardization effort as long asit does not negatively affect standards for other dialects of Lisp.In particular, the US feels that it is important not to have twostandardized dialects of Lisp that are nearly identical unless one isa strict subset of the other.  Having two such similar but differentdialects weakens the position of users who have come to depend on oneof the dialects.The US believes that the primary focus of standardization is to codifyexisting practice to support the creation and delivery of portablesoftware.  Thus, the major focus of the US standardization efforts isto provide stability to the community of Common Lisp and Scheme users.Of secondary importance are the invention of new Lisp dialects and thestandardization of Lisp dialects or features not in common usage.  TheUS therefore agrees with the ISO goal of a near term standard in the1990 time frame along with longer range consideration of futuredialects and features.Common Lisp is in wide use in Europe, Japan, and Australia.Implementations of Common Lisp are under way in the UK, Germany,Italy, and Japan (and possibly other countries).  In each of thesecountries there are companies whose customers depend on portablesoftware written in Common Lisp.  The future of these companies thusdepends on having a Common Lisp standard.The US believes that Common Lisp is a valid candidate forinternational standardization both because it is used internationallyand also because it is a mature and stable dialect.  Common Lisp hasbeen under design and specification for 8 years.  Commercial qualityimplementations of Common Lisp have been available for 4 years.  Thenear term standardization of ISO Common Lisp would have substantialpositive impact on the acceptance of existing commercial Lispimplementations and on the viability of future Lisp dialects asvehicles for emerging applications.For these reasons, the US proposes the development of an ISO standardfor Common Lisp.  Furthermore, the US proposes that WG16 request X3J13to prepare the ISO draft standard for Common Lisp.  The ISO CommonLisp draft and the ANSI Common Lisp draft should be identical.  The USbelieves such a draft standard could be developed by December 1989.The US also believes the development of an ISO standard for CommonLisp is within the charter of WG16, which endorses the standardizationof multiple dialects of Lisp. At some point in the future, it may beappropriate to develop an ISO standard for Scheme.Looking beyond near term standardization, the US feels that animportant task for WG16 is working towards a next generation dialectof Lisp, and this can be accomplished by drawing on the lessonslearned from existing dialects of Lisp.************************************************************************In addition, we proposed the following resolution:************************************************************************The U.S. proposes the following ISO WG16 resolution:It is important to affirm and strengthen the position of theinternational community of users who depend on Common Lisp.  It isalso imperative that an international standard for Common Lisp must besubject to international review and revision.ISO WG16 resolves to proceed with an ISO Common Lisp standardizationprocess in the following manner:  * WG16 requests X3J13 to produce an ISO draft standard for Common    Lisp in accordance with SC22 synchronization principles for national    body development.  * The X3J13 drafting procedure will accommodate international public    review as well as U.S. public review.  X3J13 will establish a schedule    to allow processing of all public comments.  * The timetable for forwarding a draft for circulation by WG16 is    December 1989.  The U.S. should make every effort to meet this    schedule.  * X3J13 will inform WG16 of its schedules and progress.************************************************************************The German Delegation also had a written position statement.  It is asfollows:************************************************************************	The Position of DIN concerning LISP standardization			Herbert Stoyan		    University of Konstanz		      November 18, 19881. Our GoalsWhen the LISP-standardization process started we were optimistic to reach aquick result.  Now we have to change our feeling.  It will take longer than wehave imagined.  To speed up the process we want to change some of our positionstatements made in Paris.First, we voted for CommonLISP as a starting point for standardization.  Wewant to change this commitment into an open one.  We join the US that one ofScheme or CommonLISP (but not both) should be used.Second, we made a vote for desirable characteristics of the standard.  Weregret that not all points went as we desired.  But the issues seem to bemixed: There are language issues and report issues.Before all the points, we should all agree that standardization is onlypartially a language definition activity.  We should standardize an existinglanguage.  Therefore we don't like anymore the list of default values forlanguage components.  If we still intend to follow this direction we geteverything but a language which is usable.  We don't feel that this was a goodidea.  DIN will accept any proposal for a LISP standard and check every partof it - not only functional objects etc.Obviously, the goal of standardization is portability.  Therefore this issuedeserves most attention.  We got here the right mark.  The next issue ofstandardization seems to be processor conformity.  We would like to change ourfigure `6' into a `2'.  We believe the conformity must be provable: Without aproof procedure for conformity our work is not complete.  Especially, therehas to be a test suite.The standard report must be technical clear.  Therefore a clear semantics isimportant.  It is the way to achieve portability.  We ranked this topic with`3' and support this vote again.  The standard report has to beunderstandable.  An important means to achieve this is a simple semantics.  Wemiss understandability as characteristics and again want to stress our figure`4' here.A standard report has to be usable.  That means, it should be well organized,it should not be too voluminous, it should be use not too many references toother parts.  Maybe this was meant by `Ease of learning'.  We believe thatthis characteristic is only an indicator for this quality of the standard.Therefore we want to change our figure of `12' into a `5'. Now, concerning the language.  A language to be standardized must beinteresting.  That must be already - we cannot change it.  May be this is whatwas meant as `Power'.  We want to rank this point at first place in thelanguage goals we have.  Power does not mean to provide everything.  Alanguage which is too large and complex has no power and will not beappealing.  History of programming languages proves that baroque languageswill not last for long.  Therefore we want to vote for `Compactness' - but itis not in the list of characteristics.If a language is big only because of many concepts which enable variations ofexpressions for one and the same thing then the language is defined badly.  Ifthe language contains elements which cannot be combined it should be regardedas a family of languages.  Both dimensions are called orthogonality.  We wantto vote for `Orthogonality' - but cannot find it.There are characteristics of implementations.  Issues like efficiency,consistency interpreter/compiler, stability etc. come in mind.  They are goalsfor implementors.  Good implementors will achieve them - bad implementors wilfail.  These are not goals of standardization.Ease of implementation is a goal which is always fulfilled with LISP.  The artis to find a way to quality.2. The SituationOur original proposal was to standardize a kernel of LISP with parts everybodywill accept readily.  This work could be done in 18 month.  But there are notmany countries to support this approach.Richard Gabriel made the point that three languages should not bestandardized.  We adopt this position.  We have to ask who moved us in theposition where this danger is to be faced.  Obviously, it is the pair ofUS-activities.  It was clear to ANSI that CommonLISP is not ready forstandardization.  A de-facto standard ist not a true standard.  We want notdecide without studying the latest draft of CommonLISP if it achieved enoughquality.  Furthermore, we have the feeling that the activity for standardizingScheme was started to contravene the European desire for a clean LISP kernel.3. Our ProposalISO is not an organisation for creating new languages.  The maximal thing weshould plan is to change a presented language somewhat.  The French haveexposed the three level approach.  There seems nobody (with exception of DIN)who likes the idea.Therefore: We propose to take the draft reports of CommonLISP and Schemeand check them for quality of being standardized.  If they both have thequality, we should standardize both of them with ISO.  If only one hasthe quality we should take this one.  If none of the has the quality weshould generate a list of required changes and wait for better drafts.  In themeantime other member bodies are invited to define LISPs which deservestandardization. ************************************************************************In summary, they commented that the current ISO process does not seemto be converging on a standard quickly enough, and that a short-termstandard can produced only by working with an existing dialect anddraft. They proposed that drafts for X3J13 Common Lisp and IEEE Schemebe considered and measured against several criteria. These are thatthe draft be clear and unambiguous, not unacceptably long (< 300 pageswas suggested), and precisely stated. The languages ought to be ascrisp and orthogonal as possible (that is, minimal redundantfeatures). The German Delegation proper consisted of Klaus Daessler(Siemens), Dieter Kolb (Siemens), and Herbert Stoyan (University ofKonstanz). Kolb favors Common Lisp and the other two favor Scheme, butthe German position allowed for both to be selected and standardizedby ISO.No other delegation had a written position statement. The JapaneseDelegation consisted of Professor Ito and Mr Kurokawa.  Professor Itois primarily concerned about CLOS, but after private discussions Ilearned that because of lack of study he did not understand it, andthe expert group that advises him consists of object-orientedprogramming researchers who press their own ideas on him.The French Delegation consisted of Jerome Chailloux and Greg Nuyens.They responded by remarking that the US position represented a``preposterous'' change in position by the US and directlycontradicted the agreed-upon work item. This work item was the AFNOR(French) position which was to standardize a Common-Lisp-like dialectwith no packages, simple lambda-lists, simple arrays, genericfunctions without classes, a different multiple value system, and adifferent syntax for specials. The US argued that this plan was nevervoted on because the convener would not allow it: He exaplined thatbecause it was a technical proposal, it was subject to discussion asare all other technical points.The US further remarked that the US position allowed for multiplestandardized dialects, but the convener denied this was possible underthe current work item and suggested we could try introducing a secondwork item. The French delegation contended that the US plan was to block the ISOprocess. They were right in the limited sense that I threatened toblock the standardization of any dialect of Common Lisp that wasneither a superset nor a subset of Common Lisp.I should point out that the French have formally asked SC22 (theparent group of WG16) whether naming the resulting dialect ``IsLisp''was allowed because the original work item stated that a standard for``Lisp'' was being produced. The French commented that the US voted``yes'' on the work item and that our comment about the name wasirrelevant. Jerome Chailloux's company, ILOG, has a contract fromESPRIT to produce a draft of ``ISO Lisp.'' In fact, an ESPRIT catalogwe saw stated that the draft had been produced by ILOG in 1987 and wasavailable on request.  However, to our knowledge, there is no ESPRITdraft document of ``ISO Lisp''.  All documents produced by AFNOR andILOG refer to ``ISO Lisp.''As an aside, Chailloux pointed out that he oversees a lot of theESPRIT work on AI and that he would not allow any contractor touse Common Lisp, only ISO Lisp. ILOG advertizes that ISO Lisp willbe available in the first half of 1989 (Beta available in December).He told Dussud that he would ``have the Germans back in line byDecember 15'' (which is the next EuLisp meeting).The convener declared that discussion on this topic was deadlockeduntil AFNOR could meet to decide their response to the US and Germanposition statements, which would not be until after the Hawaiimeeting.  However, the convener told Mathis in private that he did notwant to go to Hawaii and was trying to find a way to cancel themeeting. The convener also threatened to report failure to SC22 basedon his opinion that a consensus is not possible.The US delegation agreed to ask X3J13 and the IEEE Scheme groupswhether they were willing to submit drafts under the German proposal.While so agreeing, we pointed out that the convener was acting as ifthe German position would be accepted. I pointed out that the US hadnot withdrawn its proposed resolution.The US delegation repeatedly commented that the US position wasintended to support Common Lisp users and was not intended to preventother distinct standards from being established to serve othercommunities.I expect that the word from AFNOR to the European community will bethat the US deliberately tried to block the ISO process, though I'mnot sure what reason he will provide for the US actions.The second day of the meeting was devoted to three presentations:Gabriel presented a report on the progress that US Common Lisp vendorshad made in the area of delivery of applications written in CommonLisp. Mr Kurokawa presented a report on Japanese activity onprovisions within Common Lisp for international character sets. ThomLinden presented the latest X3J13 work on the same topic.  Inaddition, the U.S. was asked to present the current WG16 status oncharacter handling at the next SC22 meeting.The next ISO meeting is in March in Fairfax, Virginia.			-rpg-*start*00566 00024 US Date: 29 Nov 88 13:46From: Larry Masinter:PARC:xeroxSubject: Re: existing cleanup proposalsIn-Reply-to: DALY%ibm:COM:Xerox's message of 29 Nov 88 12:36To: DALY%ibm:COM:Xeroxcc: Larry Masinter:PARC:XeroxThe passed proposals are available for anonymous FTP on host arisia.xerox.com, in the directory "clcleanup/passed". Some of the pending proposals in draft format were distributed in hardcopy at the last X3J13 meeting; however, the cleanup committee will release versions via US Mail for comment and review in the next few weeks.*start*00835 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 01 DEC 88 13:14:55 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 1 Dec 88  13:10:39 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 01 DEC 88 12:56:20 PSTDate: 1 Dec 88 12:56 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Ballot formTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <881201-125620-4905@Xerox>My intention is to allow people to vote "Yes" "No" or"Yes if.../No but...".

Please ask ANSI to distribute the official report of thethird meeting of WG16 to the members of X3J13.But in addition of the incompleteness, there are some large mistakes in theMr Gabriel's report that I have to correct immediately:1) the name of the standard	"I should point out that the French have formally asked SC22 (the	parent group of WG16) whether naming the resulting dialect ``IsLisp''	was allowed because the original work item stated that a standard for	``Lisp'' was being produced. The French commented that the US voted	``yes'' on the work item and that our comment about the name was	irrelevant."False! This issue has been discussed at the first meeting at Paris.  Onecan read in the "Draft report of the 1st meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG16LISP," page 7 which is the official document WG16 Lisp N 12, which has beenapproved at the second meeting at Snowbird:		"...		After several rounds of straw votes ISLISP was accepted.		The Secretariat was asked to let ISO Central Secretariat		in Geneva know such a change compared to the initial title		of the New Work Item.		..."The AFNOR delegation has only asked if ISO in Geneva had given an answer.2) ESPRIT	"Jerome Chailloux's company, ILOG, has a contract from	ESPRIT to produce a draft of ``ISO Lisp.'' In fact, an ESPRIT catalog	we saw stated that the draft had been produced by ILOG in 1987 and was	available on request.  However, to our knowledge, there is no ESPRIT	draft document of ``ISO Lisp''.  All documents produced by AFNOR and	ILOG refer to ``ISO Lisp.''"Wrong! and not discussed at all at the Brussels meeting which was obviouslynot the right place to discuss that! ILOG has no Esprit contract toproduce a draft of ISO Lisp! If Mr Gabriel refers to the "TechnicalInterest Group: Lisp" funded by the Esprit Program, please let him quotethe exact and complete description of this TIG (from the 1987 annual reportISBN 92-825-8999-4). If you want to hear a fair explanation I would say:Since 1986 the Esprit Program has funded a TIG, called "EuLisp", toprepare the standardization of Lisp and to produce a draft to be proposed atwhat is called now WG16. This TIG is funded on a per-person basis and hasnothing to do with companies (the majority of the participants are in factacademic).3) ESPRIT (again)	"As an aside, Chailloux pointed out that he oversees a lot of the	ESPRIT work on AI and that he would not allow any contractor to	use Common Lisp, only ISO Lisp."Ridiculous! I am not in position to decide such policy. Please Mr Gabriel,give the exact wording of the introductory speech of Mr Omnes (from theEEC). He said that 30% of the Esprit II Program will use Lisp and that astandard (preferably an ISO Standard) is warmly desired and that thepromotion of standards is in the charter of the Esprit Program.4) ILOG Advertising	"ILOG advertizes that ISO Lisp will be available in the first	 half of 1989 (Beta available in December)."Can Mr Gabriel, give us the reference of the ILOG advertisement that herefers to?5) Next EuLisp Meeting	"He told Dussud that he would ``have the Germans back in line by	December 15'' (which is the next EuLisp meeting)."Again, this is wrong! At the next EuLisp meeting in December, the differentrepresentatives of the european national organisation of standardisationwill try to have a common position in regard with the work done at WG16because, despite the fact than some members of ANSI claim the contrary, itseems to many that the new ANSI position will give a significant change ofdirection of the work of WG16. This "radical" change has to bediscussed at different member bodies and then at the EuLisp meeting,which seems reasonable at an International Working Group.Jerome ChaillouxAFNOR representative at ISO WG16.*start*00864 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 02 DEC 88 19:25:41 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 2 Dec 88  19:20:09 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 02 DEC 88 16:30:34 PSTDate: 2 Dec 88 16:29 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Status on cleanup itemsTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.educc: masinter.paMessage-ID: <881202-163034-129@Xerox>I've finished what has been a month-long traversal alphabetically over theopen cleanup items.

The results of such research, once they becomeaccepted practice, can often be fed back into the standardization process,strengthening the technical base of the standard. But standardization efforts  are not the place for research.The position in the US statement reflects pretty muchthe state of industry with regard to the commercialization of Lisp.There is not really any demand for a commercial Lisp other than CommonLisp in the US at the moment. Since Sun, as is the case for other Lisp vendors,operates in the international marketplace, an international standard forCommon Lisp is highly desirable, since it reduces the investment Sun needsto make in developing and supporting Lisp and Lisp based tools. Nobody here believes that Common Lisp is technically the "right" solution, butthe technical challenges facing commercial Lisp today are less in termsof semantics and more in terms of implementation technology.  We expectto monitor developments in Scheme and ISO activity.We hope that the ANSI/ISO split can be resolved as quickly as possible, sothat the enormous amount of work put into the Common Lisp standard byX3J13 over the last 3 years can benefit the international Lisp community as well, and that the technical expertese of the international Lisp community can be brought to bear on the final stages of checking thedraft standard for correctness. 		James Kempf, Sun Microsystems		Cris Perdue, Sun Microsystems*start*01599 00024 USaReturn-Path: <chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.com>Received: from decwrl.dec.com ([128.45.9.1]) by Xerox.COM ; 06 DEC 88 07:58:45 PSTReceived: by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.5/4.7.34)	for masinter.pa@xerox.com; id AA03893; Tue, 6 Dec 88 07:58:33 PSTMessage-Id: <8812061558.AA03893@decwrl.dec.com>From: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comDate: 6 Dec 88 10:57To: masinter.paSubject: review of the standardLarry,I am starting to plan for the last of the major reviews of the standard. At the suggestion of Steele, Gabriel, and others, I am trying to organizea sequential review so that each mistake won't have to be found severaldifferent times.

The relevant paragraph of thatissue proposal is:   In the degenerate case where there is no last cons (i.e., the argument is   NIL) in any but the last list argument, clarify that the entire argument is   effectively ignored. Point out that in this situation, if the last argument   is a non-list, the result of APPEND or NCONC can be a non-list.Here is the nit: the use of "i.e." leads one to believe that theonly degenerate case defined is that where the argument is NIL.I suspect that "e.g." was intended, so as to make all atomic objectsignored in other than the last argument.Proposal (APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE):In the degenerate case where there is no last cons (i.e., the argumentis an atom) in any but the last list argument, clarify that the entireargument is effectively ignored. Point out that in this situation, ifthe last argument is a non-list, the result of APPEND or NCONC can bea non-list.Proposal (APPEND-ATOM:ERROR)In the degenerate case where there is no last cons (i.e., the argumentis an atom) in any but the last list argument, clarify that a value ofNIL is treated as an empty list and therefore effectively ignored, andany other atom is an error. Point out that in this situation, if thelast argument is a non-list, the result of APPEND or NCONC can be anon-list.Examples (APPEND-ATOM:DOTTED):(APPEND '(a b) 'MOOSE '(c . d)) => (a b c . d)	;Proposed(NCONC '(a b) 'MOUSSE '(c . d)) => (a b c . d)	;Proposed(APPEND 'GUACAMOLE 17) => 17			;Proposed(NCONC 'SAUERKRAUT 17) => 17			;ProposedUnder APPEND-ATOM:ERROR these cases would all be errors.Rationale: APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE makes a boundary case (a "zero-length dotted list")consistent with other cases handled by the proposal APPEND-DOTTED:REPLACE.APPEND-ATOM:ERROR would at least resolve a possible ambiguity.Current Practice:Lucid Lisp, KCL, and Symbolics Common Lisp all signal an error in bothinterpreted and compiled code.Cost to implementors:Technically, the change for APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE should be relativelysmall for those implementations which don't already implement it.However, implementations which have microcoded APPEND or NCONCincompatibly may find the small change somewhat painful.Some implementations may have optimized their APPEND or NCONC to expect onlyNIL when SAFETY is 0. In this case, depending on implementation details,requiring an ATOM check rather than a NULL check may slow things down.Cost to users:Each proposal is upward compatible.Benefits:Since dotted lists are allowed as a non-last argument, readers willprobably assume that the boundary case of a zero-length dotted list(that is, an atom) also works, something that doesn't appear to beguaranteed by a strict reading. Proposal APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE wouldhappen to legitimize such assumptions.Aesthetics:Whether or not users will think this improves the aesthetics of the languagewill depend largely on how they view the relation between lists and dottedlists. Those who view dotted lists as a special kind of list may feeldifferently than those who view lists as a special kind of dotted list.The downside of APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE is that APPEND is supposed tooperate on lists, and it is mildly offensive to let it accept atoms,and worse yet to ignore them.  Furthermore, a certain amount of usefulerror checking may be lost.Discussion:Guy Steele supports proposal APPEND-ATOM:IGNORE, but with some qualms.He raises it mainly because of the possibility thatAPPEND-DOTTED:REPLACE was not worded exactly as intended.*start*01125 00024 USaReturn-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from Think.COM ([10.4.0.6]) by Xerox.COM ; 06 DEC 88 11:37:43 PSTReceived: from fafnir.think.com by Think.COM; Tue, 6 Dec 88 13:58:26 ESTReturn-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from verdi.think.com by fafnir.think.com; Tue, 6 Dec 88 14:36:30 ESTReceived: by verdi.think.com; Tue, 6 Dec 88 14:35:03 ESTDate: Tue, 6 Dec 88 14:35:03 ESTFrom: Guy Steele <gls@Think.COM>Message-Id: <8812061935.AA12836@verdi.think.com>To: masinter.paCc: gls@Think.COMIn-Reply-To: masinter.pa@xerox.com's message of 5 Dec 88 15:07 PST <881205-150851-4403@Xerox>Subject: Issue: ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENTLarry,  According to the draft minutes of the March 1988 meeting, issueADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENT was passed as part of the big bundle, butI don't see it in the clcleanup/passed directory on arisia.

Pascal  defines      conformance in terms of both, PL/I defines conformance in terms of      conforming  programs  only.  Fortran and Ada say that a conforming      implementation correctly processes conforming programs.  Ada  goes      on to say other specific things about a conforming implementation,      Fortran does not at this  time  but  probably  will  in  its  next      standard.   The  ISO  conformance guidelines, and the draft of the      SPARC proposal discuss both programs and implementations.           For our standard, I believe we should define  conformance  in      terms   of   a   conforming   program,   and   perhaps  conforming      documentation.  Of course,  within  the  standard  itself  certain      requirements  will  be levied on the implementation.  However, the      bottom line should not be that the implementation conforms to  the      letter  of  the standard, but that a program written to the letter      of the standard  will  run  in  all  "conforming"  implementations      (defined as ones that run conforming programs).      2  DEPRECATION           Fortran successfully deprecated  one  constant.   However,  a      proposal  submitted  during its latest standardization effort that      suggested deleting old features in favor of new ones  was  opposed      vehemently.    The   Pascal  committee  is  currently  opposed  to      deprecation, and the  SPARC  proposal  suggests  that  deprecation      should be dictated by the marketplace.           For our standard, I believe we should confine deprecation  to      a  small  set of functions that are related to character handling.      I don't think it's unreasonable for a language the size of Lisp to      get  rid  of  the never-used tools.  But we don't want to generate      years of  discussion  over  a  relatively  minor  issue  when  the      standard goes for public review.      3  EXTENSIONS           I couldn't find any information that  pertained  to  language      extensions as we know them.           For our standard, it seems that extensions can be covered  in      the clauses concerning conforming documentation.  Maybe some extra      statements about what conforming programs do in  the  presence  of      extensions would be useful, but I see them as rather redundant.!                                                                Page 2      4  SUBSETS           Pascal has two levels of conforming implementations --  level      1  contains  level 0 and conformant arrays.  This was a compromise      necessary to achieve international agreement.  The 1981  PL/I  was      subsetted  and the results were a range of implementations between      the subset and the full language; nobody wanted to use the  subset      so  vendors  were forced to implement the full language eventually      anyway.  Cobol had multiple levels of subsets.  However, the  only      two  levels  that  were  important were the minimum subset and the      full language.  The middle levels  were  seldom  used  other  than      transient points to the full language.  Fortran was subsetted.  It      was felt that subsetting encouraged vendors to  implement  Fortran      and  therefore proliferate its usage, but users were quite annoyed      that one Fortran was considerably different from another.  The new      Fortran language standards committee is banning subsetting.  SPARC      feels that subsets aren't good for facilitating  interchange,  but      serve  the  purpose  of  allowing  timely  implementation  of  the      standard.           A  suggestion  that  was  made  by  most  language  committee      representatives  was to group subsetted parts meaningfully, and to      minimize the number of levels.           For our standard, I believe we should subset only if  there's      a  chance we could achieve international agreement on the standard      by doing so.  However,  if  certain  vendors  feel  strongly  that      subsetting  is  necessary,  it seems that three or four levels are      called for:  the full language  without  the  environmental  tools      (ed,  ..),  the  full  language  without  CLOS,  the full language      without the environmental tools or CLOS, and the full language.  I      do not personally believe that CLOS can be subsetted out.      5  INTERSECTING ERROR TERMINOLOGY WITH LANGUAGE CONFORMANCE           Pascal  breaks  errors   into   3   categories.    Conforming      implementations  are required to detect, encouraged to detect, ...      the different categories.           For our standard, if conformance, subsetting, and  extensions      are  well-defined,  the  error  terminology  should  be  a natural      extension,  not  much  different  from  the  terminology  I   have      previously presented.*start*00415 00024 US Date:  6 Dec 88 15:45 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: Issue: ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENTIn-reply-to: your message of Tue, 6 Dec 88 14:35:03 ESTTo: Guy Steele <gls@Think.COM>cc: masinter.paI see arisia:clcleanup/passed/adjust-array-displacementIts a unix, the names are case sensitive, and are all lower case.I'll have to reconstruct the date of passage from the meeting minutes.*start*01086 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 07 DEC 88 17:01:10 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 7 Dec 88  16:59:43 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 07 DEC 88 16:00:10 PSTDate: 7 Dec 88 15:55 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Note on mailing to members of cl-cleanupTo: CL-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <881207-160010-1681@Xerox>Please notice when you read issue writeups whether they were sent to X3J13or to cl-cleanup.

(overcoming what I hopehas been great personal restraint about my use of that tone of mail)    Date: Thu, 8 Dec 88 11:26 EST    From: "Steve Bacher (Batchman)" <SEB1525@draper.com>    I wish to register my disappointment at the decision of the cleanup committee    to flush the capability of macros to expand into declarations.  I seem to    remember that not so long ago there was a great deal of exchange on this topic    on the common-lisp mailing list, and the outcome was that it was OK for macros    to expand into declarations (but not into documentation strings).  Using that    as a justification, I went ahead and implemented PARSE-BODY with this in mind,    as well as insuring that both the interpreter and the compiler supported this    as well.        Now you tell me that you have changed your minds, and that macros may no longer    expand into declarations.  I don't think this is fair.  Maybe you shouldn't    have dropped PARSE-BODY as an issue either, but that's another issue.  I recall    that various kinds of declaration-generating forms needed this capability.    Why have youse done this?The removal of macroexpansion-into-declarations seems to be an exampleof those bulldoze-into-submission jobs I've seen on various Common-Lispmailing lists (and heard of happening at Common Lisp meetings.)I believe that it was done by because a number of implementors looked atthis one tiny wart (on a very ugly language) and thought, ``wouldn'tCommon Lisp be so much more pleasant without this?''  Besides, they keptgetting bug reports about their system code fogetting call PARSE-BODYwhen it was needed.They seem to have forgotten that there are actual -users- of Common Lispwho need to write code which is portable across differentimplementations, as efficient as possible in different implementations,and well-integrated into the host Lisp's environment.PORTABILITY requires use of standard Common Lisp constructions  (such as, say, use of the now-illegal macroexpansion into declarations.)EFFICIENCY requires that one be able to declare ``the rest list/closure  just consed has dynamic extent.''INTEGRATION often means that often one can't go around defining  MY-DEFUN, MY-LET, MY-MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND, MY-FLET, MY-LABELS, etc, etc  just so that one can get a few declarations to take effect.  An extension of the MY-DEFUN school of argument is that one should  redefine all one's code to create files full of C code...It would seem to me to be part of Common Lisp's philosophy thatperformance tuning shouldn't necessarily require duplicating large partsof the language.  I believe that's why Common Lisp has SINGLE-FLOATdeclarations rather than +$, /$, ASIN$, etc.  One could argue thatCommon Lisp should have standardised dynamic-foo-extent declarations forthe same reasons -- but the fact is that it didn't and probably neverwill, and that will leave writers of Common Lisp code in an unappealingposition if they can't write macro-declarations. CLX is a good example of a portable, efficient body of code which usesmacros-expanding-into-declarations for exactly these sort of reasons.Before it took advantage of macro-declarations with names likeDECLARE-ARRAY and DECLARE-FUNARG, CLX contained code like:(defun read-sequence-char (buffer ... &optional transform data (start 0))  #.`(declare (type buffer buffer) ...	      (type (or null sequence) data)	      ,@(funarg-declare 'transform)) ...)CLX could, of course, define its own DEFUN, FLET, etc, and write its ownPARSE-BODY.  But why make programs -- and there are others besides CLX-- do this sort of groveling when a full, hairy, wart-covered CommonLisp is there (but refuses to cooperate)?There is also the sometimes-considerable extra cost of teaching the Lispenvironments -- meta-point tools and so forth -- about the new versionsof DEFUN and FLET and so forth.  Don't laugh at these sorts of pointsoffhand; they are why some of us use Common Lisp at all.If one personally finds macroexpansion into declarations aestheticallyhorrifying remember that one is under no obligation to use them.(Besides, even the fact that I find all aspects of Common Lispmacroexpansion semantics horrifying doesn't prevent me from using macrosin order to get work done.)  I'm actually fudging this point a littlebit since macro-writers have to remember to call PARSE-BODY even ifthose writers would never use macro-declarations in their own personalcode.  My feeling is that this should just be regarded as part of theintrinsic overhead of writing Common-Lisp macros -- like the cliche ofbinding a bunch of GENSYMs, not creating BLOCKs named NIL, and so forth.I think one will find that the force for removal of this feature fromthe language came largely from implementors who either never need towrite `portable declarations,' who have the capability to add newdeclarations to their own Lisps, or who plain never considered theissues.  That is my biased impression -- I didn't attend the Common Lispmeeting where this was discussed face-to-face.Having removed an sometimes-useful ability from Common Lisp, we nowreturn to our scheduled cleanup issues of what side-effects DISASSEMBLEhas and what values REQUIRE returns -- not to mention attempts to makeROOM more portable.*start*01737 00024 USaReturn-Path: <@REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU:Mly@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>Received: from REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU ([10.3.0.44]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 DEC 88 13:58:30 PSTReceived: from JACKIE-O.AI.MIT.EDU by REAGAN.AI.MIT.EDU via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 154505; Fri 9-Dec-88 16:53:08 ESTReceived: from lucid.com (TCP 30006414401) by AI.AI.MIT.EDU  9 Dec 88 14:19:49 ESTReceived: from blacksox ([192.9.201.39]) by heavens-gate.lucid.com id AA00515g; Fri, 9 Dec 88 11:17:24 PSTReceived: by blacksox id AA00350g; Fri, 9 Dec 88 11:13:20 pstDate: Fri, 9 Dec 88 11:13:20 pstFrom: Eric Benson <eb@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8812091913.AA00350@blacksox>To: Mly@ai.ai.mit.eduIn-Reply-To: Richard Mlynarik's message of Fri, 9 Dec 88 13:58 EST <19881209185808.5.MLY@JACKIE-O.AI.MIT.EDU>Subject: Macros expanding into declarationsResent-To: Masinter.paResent-From: Richard Mlynarik <Mly@AI.AI.MIT.EDU>Resent-Date: Fri, 9 Dec 88 16:54 ESTResent-Message-ID: <19881209215416.9.MLY@JACKIE-O.AI.MIT.EDU>Resent-Comments: FYII think you overestimate the venality of the CL-Cleanup committee.

X3J13 isopen to those who would join; I am less clear about the procedurefor joining.Decisions are made by consensus when we can get it.

We've brought things for a vote to the general X3J13 where only onecommittee member was in favor of the proposal.  Do not assume thatwe endorse an issue unless the Discussion section says that we do.Once a cleanup item is released by the cleanup committee, it is broughtfor a vote at X3J13. Controversial issues are discussed, amended, tabled,and otherwise modified; some issues have been "sent back to committee"more that 6 times.Once a cleanup proposal has "passed", its only legal effect is to directthe editorial committee to incorporate the proposal body into the textof the draft being prepared; the examples, test cases, discussion do notform a part of the proposal.Once there is a draft standard, it will be available for public review bythe user community at large; the ANSI and ISO process calls for a formalreview process.*start*00894 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 DEC 88 16:36:45 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 9 Dec 88  16:36:00 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 09 DEC 88 16:35:02 PSTDate: 9 Dec 88 16:34 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Pass 2 complete: 45 out of 97 issues "released"To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <881209-163502-1409@Xerox>I've made it thru pass 2 on the cleanup issues.

Given the large number of issues, there's been more haste than usual,for which I apologize.After issues go into the mail, I will be on vacation until the new year, soplease do not expect a reply if you send mail to me alone. *start*09229 00024 USmReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 12 DEC 88 18:55:37 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 12 Dec 88  18:38:07 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 12 DEC 88 18:16:49 PSTDate: 12 Dec 88 18:16 PSTFrom: masinter.pato: x3J13@sail.stanford.eduSubject: ** BALLOT ** BALLOT ** BALLOT ** BALLOT **Message-ID: <881212-181649-5908@Xerox>The issues and proposals named below have been mailed to the X3J13 mailinglist.

Gabriel <rpg@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8812200635.AA19722@challenger>To: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduSubject: Corrections to the ISO ReportColleagues:There have been a couple of questions directed privately to me aboutmy ISO meeting report. I think the answers are of general interest, soI will direct them to the X3J13 mailing list.1. The first regards the Japanese position on CLOS. I believe thereare two concerns that the Japanese have: one is that the CLOSspecification is difficult to read and thus is difficult to evaluate;the other is that CLOS is comparatively new and represents relativelyrecent research, which leads them to believe that it would be good togather some practical experience with it before internationalstandardization. I believe this is a reasonable position. I believethe US must make its case convincingly for the Japanese to agree toadopting CLOS into a near-term international standard.2. There was a wording problem with my comments on the AFNORdelegation's response to the US position. The US indeed voted toaccept the New Work Item that is the basis for the establishment ofWG16. At the first meeting AFNOR proposed a work plan (which Iinaccurately referred to as a ``work item''). The proposed work planis to adopt Common Lisp as the starting point for IsLisp but to try toalter Common Lisp in certain ways.  The structure of the work plan isto identify features of Common Lisp that WG16 should alter and toassociate with the feature a default. For each such feature, if noacceptable technical alternative to the feature is determined within areasonable time period, the default replaces the feature.  Forexample, the package system is on the list of features to alter, andif no better solution than the current Common Lisp package system isdetermined, the default is to provide only a flat namespace - that is,the default is no package system.  The US did not agree to this workplan, and the evidence for this is simply that the acceptability ofthe work plan never came to a vote at WG16.  Therefore, the US did notchange its position regarding this work plan, and the current USposition is the first time the US took any position with regard to thework plan for WG16 proposed by the AFNOR delegation.When the AFNOR delegation stated that the US position represented a``preposterous'' change in position by the US, I interpreted theirstatement as a response to an incorrectly perceived change in positionby the US regarding the never-agreed-on AFNOR-proposed work plan. Theonly alternative interpretation I could think of is that the AFNORdelegation incorrectly perceived a change in position by the US to theNew Work Item that defines the goal of WG16.  Since the latterinterpretation is illogical, I adopted the other one.3. There was a minor error in my report on the presentation by MrKurokowa.  The following is the amended section (the word that shouldbe deleted is in [square brackets]):``Mr Kurokowa presented a report on Japanese activity on provisionswithin [Common] Lisp for international character sets. Thom Lindenpresented the latest X3J13 work on the same topic.  In addition, theU.S. was asked to present the current WG16 status on characterhandling at the next SC22 meeting.''That is, Mr Kurokowa discussed international character set handlingfor an internationally standardized Lisp and not for Common Lisp.				-rpg-*start*01820 00024 US Return-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 20 DEC 88 08:09:37 PSTReceived: from Sun.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 20 Dec 88  07:57:15 PSTReceived: from snail.Sun.COM by Sun.COM (4.1/SMI-4.0)	id AA28013; Tue, 20 Dec 88 07:59:03 PSTReceived: from suntana.sun.com by snail.Sun.COM (4.1/SMI-4.0)	id AA28535; Tue, 20 Dec 88 07:55:43 PSTReceived: from localhost by suntana.sun.com (4.0/SMI-4.0)	id AA18561; Tue, 20 Dec 88 07:56:17 PSTMessage-Id: <8812201556.AA18561@suntana.sun.com>To: Taiichi Yuasa <yuasa%tutics.tut.junet@UTOKYO-RELAY.CSNET>Cc: x3j13@SAIL.STANFORD.EDU, RPG@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUSubject: Re: Gabriel's report In-Reply-To: Your message of Tue, 20 Dec 88 12:37:46 +0200.             <8812201237.AA07407@tutics.tut.junet> Date: Tue, 20 Dec 88 07:56:14 PSTFrom: kempf@Sun.COM>concern of Japanese Lisp WG as well.

The committee has made an effort over the past 2 years to remain open to suggestions about modifying the design. There have been several electronic mailmessages from someone in Japan on the subject (it may have been Prof. Ito) which have been taken into account during the design. What changes dothe Japanese delegates feel are needed (if any) for CLOS to receive"full citizenship" in the Japanese object-oriented world, presuming,of course, that Common Lisp is accepeted as an adequate base? Is therea reasonable chance that CLOS can achieve that status, or do mostJapanese object-oriented programmers feel more confortable using Smalltalk?		jak*start*03080 00024 US Return-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 20 DEC 88 02:41:21 PSTReceived: from RELAY.CS.NET by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 20 Dec 88  02:33:05 PSTReceived: from relay2.cs.net by RELAY.CS.NET id ab19605; 20 Dec 88 4:03 ESTReceived: from utokyo-relay by RELAY.CS.NET id ab03791; 20 Dec 88 3:58 ESTReceived: by ccut.cc.u-tokyo.junet (5.51/6.3Junet-1.0/CSNET-JUNET)	id AA21505; Tue, 20 Dec 88 16:24:50 JSTReceived: by nttlab.ntt.jp (3.2/6.2NTT.h) with TCP; Tue, 20 Dec 88 15:56:01 JSTReceived: by tutics.tut.junet (ver3.3/6.2J/systemV)        id AA07407; Tue, 20 Dec 88 12:37:46 jstMessage-Id: <8812201237.AA07407@tutics.tut.junet>Date: Tue, 20 Dec 88 12:37:46 jstFrom: Taiichi Yuasa <yuasa%tutics.tut.junet@UTOKYO-RELAY.CSNET>To: x3j13@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUSubject: Gabriel's reportCc: RPG@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUAs a secretary of Japanese SC22/LISP WG, I have some comments on RichardGabriel's report on the November ISO meeting.>	Mr. Kurokawa presented a report on Japanese activity on>	provisions within Common Lisp for international character sets.This sentence is wrong.

Gabriel's message of Mon, 19 Dec 88 22:35:13 PST> 2. There was a wording problem with my comments on the AFNOR> delegation's response to the US position.I think there are two issues.  One is that the NWI does not talkabout multiple standards for multiple varieties ("dialects" mightbe prejudicial) of Lisp.  At the first WG-16 meeting in Paris,the US made the point that an ISO standard named something like"ISO Lisp" might seem to preclude standards for other varietiesof Lisp but there was not, as far as I can recall (I haven't checkedmy notes), anything said about multiple standards under the currentWork Item.  The US seemed willing then to have WG-16 work on asingle standard, even one based on Common Lisp.  Indeed, the USinsisted that the WG-16 schedule (the 18 months) required a startingpoint in existing work, and the US voted for "Common Lisp or Scheme"as the starting point.This brings us to the second issue, for which you have found theconvenient term "work plan".  I think the following is a fairsummary:  1. At the first WG-16, the US cooperated in drafting the work     plan and did not voice strong objections.  We can contrast     this with the US approach to the name of the standard, where     the US made it clear that "ISO Lisp" was unacceptable.       However, the US made the point that any deviation from     CL would need an environmental impact statement.  2. At the second WG-16, the US was unhappy with some of the defaults     and preferred that changes be deletions (so that the ISO standard     would be a strict rather than "extended" subset).  It was     explained, by the Convenor and others, that the default values     would not be adopted just because they were the defaults.  The     US seemed to accept this explanation.  3. Before the third WG-16, the US distributed a position statement     which, in effect, said that the US would oppose any changes to     Common Lisp that were not deletions.  This was a hardening of     what seemed to be the US position in the second meeting, because     changes would be opposed simply because they were not deletions,     regardless of technical or practical merit.  (Of course,     deletions might still be opposed on those grounds, and such     reasons might be given as additional reasons for opposing     non-deletions.)So, it appears to me that the US position has changed.  Whether itis a "preposterous" change is less clear.  It might be argued thatthe position has evolved.  Nonetheless, > The US did not agree to this work plan, and the evidence for this> is simply that the acceptability of the work plan never came to a> vote at WG16.  Therefore, the US did not change its position regarding> this work plan, and the current US position is the first time the US> took any position with regard to the work plan for WG16 proposed by the> AFNOR delegation.It can be argued that the US has officially said only three things.One is the comment on the NWI stating opposition to the name "ISOLisp".  Another is the position statement distributed before the3rd WG-16.  Then, finally, there's the proposal for an ISO CommonLisp standard presented at the 3rd meeting.  Indeed, it might beargued that only the first is really official, because only itinvolved a vote in X3J13 (if even that is enough).  However, ifwe're to take a "letter of the law" approach, it must be noted thata change from no official position to official opposition is stilla change.There is one additional point I would like to make.  Although theinitial list of issues and defaults, and the idea that we shouldproceed in this way, came from AFNOR, the final list was the resultof comments by other countries, including the US.

Gabriel's message of Mon, 19 Dec 88 22:35:13 PST> 2. There was a wording problem with my comments on the AFNOR> delegation's response to the US position.I think there are two issues.  One is that the NWI does not talkabout multiple standards for multiple varieties ("dialects" mightbe prejudicial) of Lisp.  At the first WG-16 meeting in Paris,the US made the point that an ISO standard named something like"ISO Lisp" might seem to preclude standards for other varietiesof Lisp but there was not, as far as I can recall (I haven't checkedmy notes), anything said about multiple standards under the currentWork Item.  The US seemed willing then to have WG-16 work on asingle standard, even one based on Common Lisp.  Indeed, the USinsisted that the WG-16 schedule (the 18 months) required a startingpoint in existing work, and the US voted for "Common Lisp or Scheme"as the starting point.This brings us to the second issue, for which you have found theconvenient term "work plan".  I think the following is a fairsummary:  1. At the first WG-16, the US cooperated in drafting the work     plan and did not voice strong objections.  We can contrast     this with the US approach to the name of the standard, where     the US made it clear that "ISO Lisp" was unacceptable.       However, the US made the point that any deviation from     CL would need an environmental impact statement.  2. At the second WG-16, the US was unhappy with some of the defaults     and preferred that changes be deletions (so that the ISO standard     would be a strict rather than "extended" subset).  It was     explained, by the Convenor and others, that the default values     would not be adopted just because they were the defaults.  The     US seemed to accept this explanation.  3. Before the third WG-16, the US distributed a position statement     which, in effect, said that the US would oppose any changes to     Common Lisp that were not deletions.  This was a hardening of     what seemed to be the US position in the second meeting, because     changes would be opposed simply because they were not deletions,     regardless of technical or practical merit.  (Of course,     deletions might still be opposed on those grounds, and such     reasons might be given as additional reasons for opposing     non-deletions.)So, it appears to me that the US position has changed.  Whether itis a "preposterous" change is less clear.  It might be argued thatthe position has evolved.  Nonetheless, > The US did not agree to this work plan, and the evidence for this> is simply that the acceptability of the work plan never came to a> vote at WG16.  Therefore, the US did not change its position regarding> this work plan, and the current US position is the first time the US> took any position with regard to the work plan for WG16 proposed by the> AFNOR delegation.It can be argued that the US has officially said only three things.One is the comment on the NWI stating opposition to the name "ISOLisp".  Another is the position statement distributed before the3rd WG-16.  Then, finally, there's the proposal for an ISO CommonLisp standard presented at the 3rd meeting.  Indeed, it might beargued that only the first is really official, because only itinvolved a vote in X3J13 (if even that is enough).  However, ifwe're to take a "letter of the law" approach, it must be noted thata change from no official position to official opposition is stilla change.There is one additional point I would like to make.  Although theinitial list of issues and defaults, and the idea that we shouldproceed in this way, came from AFNOR, the final list was the resultof comments by other countries, including the US.  Moreover, thereappeared to be a consensus (that included the US) on the followingstatement:   The draft standard to be provided by the Working Group within   18 months will take as starting point Common Lisp (with X3J13   cleanups) with treatment of major issues and default values   to be identified (including issues in the AFNOR list and on   agenda).> When the AFNOR delegation stated that the US position represented a> ``preposterous'' change in position by the US, I interpreted their> statement as a response to an incorrectly perceived change in position> by the US regarding the never-agreed-on AFNOR-proposed work plan.

If these problems arefixed, then I'll vote YES.1. The proposal explicitely says to allow &OPTIONAL, &KEY, and &AUX keywords,but fails to mention &REST and &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS.2. The proposal does not say how defaulting is to be done when the programmerdoesn't supply a default value for a keyword argument.  I assume that theintent is that it will do defaulting in the same way &OPTIONAL arguments arespecified to default in CLtL, ie. if no default is supplied in the lambda-listthen use the slot initform, else undefined.3. The proposal does not say which of key/var gets matched to the slot name inkeyword parameter specifiers of the form ((key var) [default [svar]]).  Iassume that it should be var that gets matched, since that gives the programmerthe most options, but this needs to be stated explicitely.Note for Current Practice:  The latest version of IIM Common Lisp implementsthis.===============================================================================DEFSTRUCT-PRINT-FUNCTION-INHERITANCE:YES	Version 3, 7 Dec 88, Mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NAME:DUPLICATES-ERROR	Version 4, 31-Oct-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:EXPLICITLY-VAGUEDESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:NO	Version 4, 15-Nov-88	, Mailed 7-Dec-88EXPLICITLY-VAGUE: ABSTAINNO: YESI sort of agree with the arguments for disallowing interaction, but I won't betoo upset if the NO proposal gets shot down and we have to go toEXPLICTLY-VAGUE. ===============================================================================DOTTED-MACRO-FORMS:ALLOW	Version 3, 15-Nov-88, Mailed 7-Dec-88YES===============================================================================EQUAL-STRUCTURE:STATUS-QUO	Version 5, 1-Oct-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88I thought this had been pretty well hashed out, so I was surprised to find someserious problems with the proposal.  While I support the general idea of theproposal, I can't vote in favor of it in its current form.  If these things getcleaned up, then I'll vote YES.  Note that all of my problems with the currentproposal have to do with EQUALP; I agree with the proposal for EQUAL, and wouldvote YES for it as a seperate issue if the EQUALP stuff can't be resolved intime. 1. The description of EQUALP's behavior does not match CLtL, since itreferences EQUAL more than it ought.  Specifically, characters should becompared with CHAR-EQUAL, and numbers should be compared with =, while theproposal says EQL for numbers (by defaulting to EQUAL) and is ambiguous aboutcharacters (could be EQL (by defaulting to EQUAL) or CHAR-EQUAL (since stringcomparisons are case insensitive)).2. The proposal says EQUALP descends arrays, structures, and instances, butuses EQ on other types, and gives hash-tables as an example of a data typewhich is not descended.  What if, in a given implementation, hash-tables areimplemented using structures or instances.  Does this mean that such animplementation must include code in EQUALP to explicitely prevent descendinginto hash-tables (and presumably any other COMMON types which are implementedusing structures or instances)?  This question has to be answered if the use ofEQUALP is to have any chance of being portable when applied to such objects.===============================================================================EXIT-EXTENT:MINIMALEXIT-EXTENT:MEDIUM	Version 5, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88MINIMAL:  NO, for reasons I have discussed on the mailing list.  Basically, Ifeel this seriously damages the semantics of the language, playing havoc withboth UNWIND-PROTECT and the definition of dynamic-scope.MEDIUM:  Currently NO, even though the intent of this proposal is what I want,because the current proposal is poorly written.  I don't believe it is reallyready for voting yet.  I agree with Moon's comment that this may be hard towrite in a reasonably implementation-independent way.  My intuition is based onthe nesting of forms, but I'm not sure how constraining a writup based on thatwould be (though obviously somewhat, since the technique Symbolic's uses isinvalidated by acceptence of something like this proposal).===============================================================================EXPT-RATIO:P.211	Version 3, 31-Oct-88, Mailed 7 Dec 88YES===============================================================================FIXNUM-NON-PORTABLE:TIGHTEN-DEFINITIONFIXNUM-NON-PORTABLE:TIGHTEN-FIXNUM-TOSS-BIGNUM	Version 4, 7-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88NO on both.Basically, I don't think either proposal really addresses the problemadequately.  I'm looking at this from the point of view of someone who hasdealt with porting C programs between machines with different native wordsizes, and therefor different definitions of the 'int' type.  I see many of thesame kinds of problems here, and the approach being taken by these proposalsreally doesn't do anything about them.Actually, I think a case could be made in favor of a third proposal,TOSS-FIXNUM-TOSS-BIGNUM, making it explicit that neither is portable.  I'm notplanning to put this forward as a serious proposal though, since I expect itwould go over like a lead balloon for historical reasons if nothing else.There are relatively few legitimate uses of FIXNUM in portable code, andlegislating the definition of FIXNUM in a fairly ad hoc way is not going toimprove the situation.  About the only place the FIXNUM type specifier shouldappear in portable code is as part of the definition of a type used by theportable code, with the definition parameterized according to theimplementation being ported to.  Even there it is probably better to use rangedinteger type specifiers.===============================================================================FORMAT-E-EXPONENT-SIGN:FORCE-SIGN	Version 2, 2 Oct 88, Mailed 6 Oct 88YES===============================================================================FORMAT-PRETTY-PRINT:YES	Version 7, 15 Dec 88, Mailed 7 Dec 88YES===============================================================================FUNCTION-COMPOSITION:NEW-FUNCTIONSFUNCTION-COMPOSITION:COMPLEMENT-AND-ALWAYS	Version 4, 12 Dec 88, Mailed 12 Dec 88NEW-FUNCTIONS: NO.

Encourage people to add extensions like this, and we'll see whatresults when we do CL9x (or CL2001).COMPLEMENT-AND-ALWAYS: YES.  I can see COMPLEMENT being a useful standardshorthand that makes the removal of the :test-not and -if-not stuff morepalatable.===============================================================================FUNCTION-TYPE-ARGUMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS:RESTRICTIVE	Version 3, 7-Dec-88, Mailed  12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================FUNCTION-TYPE-REST-LIST-ELEMENT:USE-ACTUAL-ARGUMENT-TYPE	Version 5, 14-Nov-88	, Mailed 8-Dec-88NO===============================================================================HASH-TABLE-STABILITY:KEY-TRANSFORM-RESTRICTIONS	Version 1, 11-Nov-88	, Mailed 12 Dec 88YES.There is a minor glitch in an aside that needs to be fixed.

All metastreams must nowsupport PEEK-CHAR directly, and pass it along to the indirect streams, in casesome of those streams are echo streams.  This mostly increases the cost toimplementors, though it is also a cost to users in systems where the set ofmetastreams is user-extensible. ===============================================================================PRINT-CIRCLE-STRUCTURE:USER-FUNCTIONS-WORK	Version 3, 20 Sep 88, Mailed 8 Oct 88YES===============================================================================PROCLAIM-LEXICAL:LG	Version 9, 8-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88===============================================================================RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS:INTEGER-AND-INTEGER-NIL	Version 1, 14-Sep-88, Mailed 7 Oct 88YES===============================================================================REQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS:ELIMINATE	Version 6, 9 Dec 88, mailed 09 Dec 88YES===============================================================================REST-LIST-ALLOCATION:NEWLY-ALLOCATEDREST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MAY-SHAREREST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MUST-SHARE	Version 3, 12-Dec-88, mailed 12-Dec-88NEWLY-ALLOCATED: NOMUST-SHARE: NOI feel that both of these take away too much implementation freedom.  Whichleaves us with ...MAY-SHARE: YES.But I'd like to see something added that allows the programmer to force copyingwhen she cares, without requiring an explicit call to COPY-LIST (possiblyfeaturized).  Note that most cases of COPY-LIST on &REST parameters that I'veseen had nothing to do with the question of whether apply => &rest could share;they were put in to deal with implementations which always stack-cons &restlists.===============================================================================ROOM-DEFAULT-ARGUMENT:NEW-VALUE	Version 1 12-Sep-88 mailed 8 Oct 88YESI liked KMP's suggestion of defining additional synonyms:  :short    ==  nil  :medium   ==  :default  :long     ==  tThis could be done as a seperate proposal, but hardly seems worth the effort.===============================================================================SETF-SUB-METHODS:DELAYED-ACCESS-STORES	Version 5, 12-Feb-88 mailed 8 Oct 88YES===============================================================================STANDARD-INPUT-INITIAL-BINDING:DEFINED-CONTRACTS	Version 8, 8 Jul 88, Mailed 7 Oct 88YES===============================================================================STEP-ENVIRONMENT:CURRENT	Version 3, 20-Jun-88, mailed  7 Oct 88I have no problem with TIME behaving as proposed.

This can be considered the'official' position of IIM.  I've included extensive comments on a fewissues.I consider some of these issues controversial, and not appropriate to ablockvote.  I've commented on some of them as to why I think they have problems.I'm going to send these comments out for general distribution so thatpeoplecan respond, but I'm also including them here to help you tell which onesI'mjust voting yes/no on and which ones I think need further work or should bevoted separately. I have not voted on the following issues because I don't have a copy of thecurrent proposal to read.  If I can obtain copies of them in time I'll sendaseperate response for just them. Yes, I know about /clcleanup/pending onarisia, but repeated FTP attempts haven't gotten me anywhere.kab===============================================================================ARRAY-TYPE-ELEMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS:UNIFY-UPGRADINGCLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS:ALLOW-INQUIRYDECLARE-FUNCTION-AMBIGUITY:DELETE-FTYPE-ABBREVIATIONDECLARE-TYPE-FREE:ALLOWFUNCTION-DEFINITION:FUNCTION-SOURCEGET-MACRO-CHARACTER-READTABLE:NIL-STANDARDHASH-TABLE-PACKAGE-GENERATORS:ADD-WITH-WRAPPERHASH-TABLE-TESTS:ADD-EQUALPLAMBDA-FORM:NEW-MACROLCM-NO-ARGUMENTS:1LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION:DISALLOWNTH-VALUE:ADDPACKAGE-DELETION:NEW-FUNCTIONPATHNAME-TYPE-UNSPECIFIC:NEW-TOKENRANGE-OF-COUNT-KEYWORD:NIL-OR-INTEGERRETURN-VALUES-UNSPECIFIED:SPECIFYSETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO:SETF-FUNCTIONSSETF-PLACES:ADD-SETF-FUNCTIONSSTREAM-ACCESS:ADD-TYPES-PREDICATES-ACCESSORSSTREAM-INFO:ONE-DIMENSIONAL-FUNCTIONSSYMBOL-MACROLET-DECLARE:ALLOWTAGBODY-CONTENTS:FORBID-EXTENSIONTEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-ALLTEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-TEST-NOTVARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRY:SYMMETRIZE===============================================================================And now for the voting ...===============================================================================ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIED:SPECIFY	Version 4, 21-Sep-88, Mailed 4 Dec 88YES===============================================================================CONTAGION-ON-NUMERICAL-COMPARISONS:TRANSITIVE	Version 1, 14-Sep-88, Mailed 6 Oct 88YES===============================================================================DECLARATION-SCOPE:NO-HOISTINGDECLARATION-SCOPE:LIMITED-HOISTING	Version 4, 15-Nov-88, Mailed 9-Dec-88NO on both proposals.I really don't like NO-HOISTING because it is too imcompatible.  I think Icould live with LIMITED-HOISTING, but I'm unconvinced of the need for suchanincompatible change.  All of the problem examples are easily solved bysimplychanging some of the variable names.===============================================================================DECODE-UNIVERSAL-TIME-DAYLIGHT:LIKE-ENCODE	Version 2, 30-Sep-88, Mailed 6 Oct 88YES===============================================================================DEFPACKAGE:ADDITION	Version 7, 2-Nov-88, Mailed 5 Dec 88YES===============================================================================DEFSTRUCT-CONSTRUCTOR-KEY-MIXTURE:ALLOW-KEY	Version 2, 21-Sep-88, Mailed 6 Oct 88While I support the concept, the wording needs cleanup.  If these problemsarefixed, then I'll vote YES.1. The proposal explicitely says to allow &OPTIONAL, &KEY, and &AUXkeywords,but fails to mention &REST and &ALLOW-OTHER-KEYS.2. The proposal does not say how defaulting is to be done when theprogrammerdoesn't supply a default value for a keyword argument.  I assume that theintent is that it will do defaulting in the same way &OPTIONAL argumentsarespecified to default in CLtL, ie. if no default is supplied in thelambda-listthen use the slot initform, else undefined.3. The proposal does not say which of key/var gets matched to the slot nameinkeyword parameter specifiers of the form ((key var) [default [svar]]).  Iassume that it should be var that gets matched, since that gives theprogrammerthe most options, but this needs to be stated explicitely.Note for Current Practice:  The latest version of IIM Common Lispimplementsthis.===============================================================================DEFSTRUCT-PRINT-FUNCTION-INHERITANCE:YES	Version 3, 7 Dec 88, Mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================DEFSTRUCT-SLOTS-CONSTRAINTS-NAME:DUPLICATES-ERROR	Version 4, 31-Oct-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:EXPLICITLY-VAGUEDESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:NO	Version 4, 15-Nov-88	, Mailed 7-Dec-88EXPLICITLY-VAGUE: ABSTAINNO: YESI sort of agree with the arguments for disallowing interaction, but I won'tbetoo upset if the NO proposal gets shot down and we have to go toEXPLICTLY-VAGUE. ===============================================================================DOTTED-MACRO-FORMS:ALLOW	Version 3, 15-Nov-88, Mailed 7-Dec-88YES===============================================================================EQUAL-STRUCTURE:STATUS-QUO	Version 5, 1-Oct-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88I thought this had been pretty well hashed out, so I was surprised to findsomeserious problems with the proposal.  While I support the general idea oftheproposal, I can't vote in favor of it in its current form.  If these thingsgetcleaned up, then I'll vote YES.  Note that all of my problems with thecurrentproposal have to do with EQUALP; I agree with the proposal for EQUAL, andwouldvote YES for it as a seperate issue if the EQUALP stuff can't be resolvedintime. 1. The description of EQUALP's behavior does not match CLtL, since itreferences EQUAL more than it ought.  Specifically, characters should becompared with CHAR-EQUAL, and numbers should be compared with =, while theproposal says EQL for numbers (by defaulting to EQUAL) and is ambiguousaboutcharacters (could be EQL (by defaulting to EQUAL) or CHAR-EQUAL (sincestringcomparisons are case insensitive)).2. The proposal says EQUALP descends arrays, structures, and instances, butuses EQ on other types, and gives hash-tables as an example of a data typewhich is not descended.  What if, in a given implementation, hash-tablesareimplemented using structures or instances.  Does this mean that such animplementation must include code in EQUALP to explicitely preventdescendinginto hash-tables (and presumably any other COMMON types which areimplementedusing structures or instances)?  This question has to be answered if theuse ofEQUALP is to have any chance of being portable when applied to suchobjects.===============================================================================EXIT-EXTENT:MINIMALEXIT-EXTENT:MEDIUM	Version 5, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88MINIMAL:  NO, for reasons I have discussed on the mailing list.  Basically,Ifeel this seriously damages the semantics of the language, playing havocwithboth UNWIND-PROTECT and the definition of dynamic-scope.MEDIUM:  Currently NO, even though the intent of this proposal is what Iwant,because the current proposal is poorly written.  I don't believe it isreallyready for voting yet.  I agree with Moon's comment that this may be hard towrite in a reasonably implementation-independent way.  My intuition isbased onthe nesting of forms, but I'm not sure how constraining a writup based onthatwould be (though obviously somewhat, since the technique Symbolic's uses isinvalidated by acceptence of something like this proposal).===============================================================================EXPT-RATIO:P.211	Version 3, 31-Oct-88, Mailed 7 Dec 88YES===============================================================================FIXNUM-NON-PORTABLE:TIGHTEN-DEFINITIONFIXNUM-NON-PORTABLE:TIGHTEN-FIXNUM-TOSS-BIGNUM	Version 4, 7-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88NO on both.Basically, I don't think either proposal really addresses the problemadequately.  I'm looking at this from the point of view of someone who hasdealt with porting C programs between machines with different native wordsizes, and therefor different definitions of the 'int' type.  I see many ofthesame kinds of problems here, and the approach being taken by theseproposalsreally doesn't do anything about them.Actually, I think a case could be made in favor of a third proposal,TOSS-FIXNUM-TOSS-BIGNUM, making it explicit that neither is portable.  I'mnotplanning to put this forward as a serious proposal though, since I expectitwould go over like a lead balloon for historical reasons if nothing else.There are relatively few legitimate uses of FIXNUM in portable code, andlegislating the definition of FIXNUM in a fairly ad hoc way is not going toimprove the situation.  About the only place the FIXNUM type specifiershouldappear in portable code is as part of the definition of a type used by theportable code, with the definition parameterized according to theimplementation being ported to.  Even there it is probably better to userangedinteger type specifiers.===============================================================================FORMAT-E-EXPONENT-SIGN:FORCE-SIGN	Version 2, 2 Oct 88, Mailed 6 Oct 88YES===============================================================================FORMAT-PRETTY-PRINT:YES	Version 7, 15 Dec 88, Mailed 7 Dec 88YES===============================================================================FUNCTION-COMPOSITION:NEW-FUNCTIONSFUNCTION-COMPOSITION:COMPLEMENT-AND-ALWAYS	Version 4, 12 Dec 88, Mailed 12 Dec 88NEW-FUNCTIONS: NO.  I agree with some of the discussion that this is aninadequate set of operators, it is untested by the community, and serves novisible need.  Encourage people to add extensions like this, and we'll seewhatresults when we do CL9x (or CL2001).COMPLEMENT-AND-ALWAYS: YES.  I can see COMPLEMENT being a useful standardshorthand that makes the removal of the :test-not and -if-not stuff morepalatable.===============================================================================FUNCTION-TYPE-ARGUMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS:RESTRICTIVE	Version 3, 7-Dec-88, Mailed  12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================FUNCTION-TYPE-REST-LIST-ELEMENT:USE-ACTUAL-ARGUMENT-TYPE	Version 5, 14-Nov-88	, Mailed 8-Dec-88NO===============================================================================HASH-TABLE-STABILITY:KEY-TRANSFORM-RESTRICTIONS	Version 1, 11-Nov-88	, Mailed 12 Dec 88YES.There is a minor glitch in an aside that needs to be fixed.  Paragraph 3 ofitem 3 says that the following code would be acceptable as the <sxh>functionfor EQL tables:  (if (numberp x) (sxhash x) (%unique-no x))In general, the NUMBERP test really should be (OR (NUMBERP X) (CHARACTERPX)),to correspond properly to the definition of EQL.===============================================================================IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY:SELECT-ONLY	Version 4, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================MAKE-PACKAGE-USE-DEFAULT:IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT	Version 2, 8 Oct 88, Mailed 12-Dec-88NO===============================================================================MAPPING-DESTRUCTIVE-INTERACTION:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE	Version 2, 09-Jun-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88YES===============================================================================PACKAGE-CLUTTER:REDUCE	Version 6, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-881YES, but note such that symbols which are documented special-forms are alsoFBOUNDP.===============================================================================PEEK-CHAR-READ-CHAR-ECHO:FIRST-READ-CHAR	Version 3, 8-Oct-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88YESHowever, I think it should be mentioned that this implies that PEEK-CHAR isreally no longer equivelent to read-char followed by unread-char, and can'tbeimplemented that way for any kind of metastream.  All metastreams must nowsupport PEEK-CHAR directly, and pass it along to the indirect streams, incasesome of those streams are echo streams.  This mostly increases the cost toimplementors, though it is also a cost to users in systems where the set ofmetastreams is user-extensible. ===============================================================================PRINT-CIRCLE-STRUCTURE:USER-FUNCTIONS-WORK	Version 3, 20 Sep 88, Mailed 8 Oct 88YES===============================================================================PROCLAIM-LEXICAL:LG	Version 9, 8-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88===============================================================================RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS:INTEGER-AND-INTEGER-NIL	Version 1, 14-Sep-88, Mailed 7 Oct 88YES===============================================================================REQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS:ELIMINATE	Version 6, 9 Dec 88, mailed 09 Dec 88YES===============================================================================REST-LIST-ALLOCATION:NEWLY-ALLOCATEDREST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MAY-SHAREREST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MUST-SHARE	Version 3, 12-Dec-88, mailed 12-Dec-88NEWLY-ALLOCATED: NOMUST-SHARE: NOI feel that both of these take away too much implementation freedom.  Whichleaves us with ...MAY-SHARE: YES.But I'd like to see something added that allows the programmer to forcecopyingwhen she cares, without requiring an explicit call to COPY-LIST (possiblyfeaturized).  Note that most cases of COPY-LIST on &REST parameters thatI'veseen had nothing to do with the question of whether apply => &rest couldshare;they were put in to deal with implementations which always stack-cons &restlists.===============================================================================ROOM-DEFAULT-ARGUMENT:NEW-VALUE	Version 1 12-Sep-88 mailed 8 Oct 88YESI liked KMP's suggestion of defining additional synonyms:  :short    ==  nil  :medium   ==  :default  :long     ==  tThis could be done as a seperate proposal, but hardly seems worth theeffort.===============================================================================SETF-SUB-METHODS:DELAYED-ACCESS-STORES	Version 5, 12-Feb-88 mailed 8 Oct 88YES===============================================================================STANDARD-INPUT-INITIAL-BINDING:DEFINED-CONTRACTS	Version 8, 8 Jul 88, Mailed 7 Oct 88YES===============================================================================STEP-ENVIRONMENT:CURRENT	Version 3, 20-Jun-88, mailed  7 Oct 88I have no problem with TIME behaving as proposed.  I have serious problemswithSTEP though, as far as compiled behavior.  I don't agree that it is easy togetthe environment right in this case, because it would require theinterpreter tohandle compiler data structures, which might not even be possible.  MaybeI'mmisunderstanding what is wanted for compiled STEP.  If what is wanted isthatexecution of interpreted code which occurs within the context of the STEPmacroshould be stepped, then that's ok, and I'll vote YES.===============================================================================SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE:CLARIFY	Version 4,  7-Oct-88, mailed 7 Oct 88 YES===============================================================================SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS:SPECIAL-FORM	Version 5, 30-Nov-88, mailed 9 Dec 88YES===============================================================================TAILP-NIL:T	Version 5, 9-Dec-88, mailed 12-Dec-88YES===============================================================================TYPE-OF-UNDERCONSTRAINED:ADD-CONSTRAINTS	Version 3, 12-Dec-88, mailed 12 Dec 88	(some "bugs" in the proposal)YES, assuming bugs are fixed.

Otherwise it looks ok.Comment on DECLARE-FUNCTION-AMBIGUITY (Version 4, 05-Dec-88) Moon is mildly opposed to this proposal, DELETE-FTYPE-ABBREVIATION, because he sees it as gratuitously incompatible. Pitman favors the proposal because he thinks the benefit of making things regular will outweigh the costs.Comment on DECLARE-TYPE-FREE (Version 8, 07-Dec-88) Moon approved of an earlier version of this proposal, and wrote  a new option, LEXICAL, as part of a version 9 which has not been released to X3J13. Both Moon and Pitman support the LEXICAL proposal, version 9.Comment on DEFPACKAGE (Version 7, 02-Nov-88) The semantics should be defined in terms of the existing package functions rather than being redundantly described, in order to minimize the risk that DEFPACKAGE and the package functions will accidentally differ in some unintended way.Comment on DEFSTRUCT-CONSTRUCTOR-KEY-MIXTURE (Version 2, 21-Sep-88) The proposal should accomodate comments by IIM about some keywords that were (presumably accidentally) not addressed Comment on DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE (Version 4, 15-Nov-88) We prefer option EXPLICITLY-VAGUE. We would vote "Yes" for the NO option iff EXPLICITLY-VAGUE fails.Comment on EQUAL-STRUCTURE (Version 5, 01-Oct-88) There are important technical comments about EQUALP which have not been addressed, and which we feel must be addressed before this is brought to a serious vote. Ultimately, when those pending technical comments have been addressed, we expect to buy into this proposal.Comment on EXIT-EXTENT (Version 5, 12-Dec-88) Sadly, we feel it is still premature to vote on this issue at this time. There are too many errors and inconsistencies in the writeup.Comment on FORMAT-PRETTY-PRINT (Version 7, 15-Dec-88) Although some fixes were made to accomodate ~R, some minor lingering questions remain, which should be addressed under separate cover:   - Is PRINT-OBJECT used to print things of type FLOAT in any cases     where ~$, ~E, ~F, or ~G is used?   - Can users write any methods (including :AROUND, :BEFORE, etc) for     PRINT-OBJECT on type FLOAT? If the answers to both of these questions end up being "Yes", then it matters whether any of those format ops bind *PRINT-BASE* in order to achieve the effect prescribed by CLtL of always printing floats in  base 10. If the answer to either of those questions is "No", then it doesn't matter.Comment on FUNCTION-COMPOSITION (Version 4, 12-Dec-88) Barry Margolin's complaint about the degenerate case of COMPOSE should be fixed in both proposals. We prefer option NEW-FUNCTIONS. We would vote "Yes" for COMPLEMENT-AND-ALWAYS iff NEW-FUNCTIONS fails.Comment on FUNCTION-TYPE-REST-LIST-ELEMENT (Version 5, 14-Nov-88)  It turns out the list type specifier being contemplated wouldn't have helped the case of alternating keyword value pairs because `repetitions' were not among the issues being addressed by those working on that topic.Comment on GET-MACRO-CHARACTER-READTABLE (Version 2, 8-Dec-88) The proposal is ok, but the test case is wrong and should definitely be fixed before a vote is called. EQness of successive results from  GET-MACRO-CHARACTER when given the same arguments is not guaranteed currently, and the new proposal does not suggest causing such a thing.Comment on HASH-TABLE-PACKAGE-GENERATORS (Version 7, 08-Dec-88) The test-package-iterator example has the values from the generator in the wrong order. This should be fixed before the actual vote.Comment on HASH-TABLE-STABILITY (Version 1, 11-Nov-88) We believe that it is not appropriate to vote on this issue at this time. Neither of us had the patience to figure out in enough detail what it was saying to have any confidence in our opinions on the issue. If there is really something important going on here, it should be possible to say briefly and in plain English what the problem being  addressed is and what the nature of the solution is. If, after a brief, intelligible, high level discussion of the issue, details must be presented to back up the high level goals, that would be fine.Comment on HASH-TABLE-TESTS (Version 2, 08-Dec-88) We would really like to see = hash tables, too.Provision on IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY (Version 4, 12-Dec-88) Our "Yes" vote is contingent on the DEFPACKAGE passing.Provision on LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION (Version 5, 22-Nov-88) We're reluctant to include the paragraph about permitting (DEFVAR CAR ...). Our vote is "Yes" only if the paragraph suggesting this is permissible is removed.Comment on MAKE-PACKAGE-USE-DEFAULT (Version 2, 08-Oct-88) We oppose this issue because:   - It is not clearly in the best interest of programmers in a supposedly     portable language to give up the most convenient package creation     syntax to a non-portable purpose.   - The justifications given in the proposal are not strong enough to     support an incompatible change like this.   - This is a special-case hack that does not generalize. There is     no way to create a package based on the implementation-dependent     default -and- other packages.   - It would be just as easy for someone to say        :USE (PACKAGE-USE-LIST (FIND-PACKAGE "USER"))     At least this technique generalizes.   - The Rationale uses incorrect suppositions to arrive at a false     generalization. Cloe doesn't have the asymmetry referred to.   - The current practice is not correct.     No mention of what Cloe does is attempted.   - Even allowing the default to be controlled by a variable does     not help because it encourages programs to be developed depending     on defaults which are not part of those programs, and therefore     works against portability.   - The Discussion section does not correctly reflect discussion.     For example, Pitman has repeatedly voiced strong opposition.     The Discussion mentions neither the fact that he objected nor the     reasons for his objection.Comment on NTH-VALUE (Version 4, 08-Dec-88) The proposal should clarify the treatment of n when it is out of range. Any non-negative integer index values should be permitted. NIL should result if the index argument is too large.Comment on PACKAGE-CLUTTER (Version 6, 12-Dec-88) This leaves implementations freedom to hack any properties other than those in the LISP, KEYWORD, and USER packages.  In fact, though, the user should probably also have rights over the system in packages he creates. This will be an incompatible change -- possibly a major one -- for Genera, which uses properties named by keywords and by symbols in the LISP package. However, we think the change is worthwhile. In general, Genera tries not to distinguish "the system" from "the user". Anything the system is permitted to do, the user is permitted to do. As such, we feel a little odd about placing restrictions on the system which are not likewise placed on the user. In fact, if the system can cause problems in this way, the user can, too. This proposal is only  heuristic. We're voting "Yes" because it's probably a change for the better. But we won't be surprised if ultimately it is not seen to be the right way to achieve the high-level goal. LEXICAL, TYPE, INLINE, NOTINLINE, and FTYPE proclamations should be explicitly ruled out (just as SPECIAL is) except that TYPE is allowed if it's a CL variable, and FTYPE, INLINE, and NOTINLINE are allowed if it's a CL function. The DECLARATION proclamation probably be explicitly allowed (because  we see no reason not to permit it).Comment on PEEK-CHAR-READ-CHAR-ECHO (Version 3, 08-Oct-88) There are some typos in this proposal that need to be corrected. Also, IIM asked for a clarification which seemed reasonable to us.Comment on PROCLAIM-LEXICAL (Version 9, 08-Dec-88) The proposal might want to define the status of unproclaimed free variables. Presumably, we should say that they are an error, and we should encourage compilers to issue a warning.Comment on SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO (Version 3, 04-Nov-87) We think it's premature to vote on this issue at this time. We suggest that a better proposal, unifying this issue with SETF-PLACES, should be produced either before or during the upcoming meeting.Comment on SETF-PLACES (Version 1, 11-Nov-88) We think it's premature to vote on this issue at this time. We suggest that a better proposal, unifying this issue with  SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO, should be produced either before or during the upcoming meeting. Provision on STEP-ENVIRONMENT (Version 3, 20-Jun-88) We don't understand    "it is acceptable for an implementation to interactively step     through only those parts of the evaluation that are interpreted." There are a variety of ways to clarify this that would satisfy us. Still, this must be clarified so we can know for sure what we're voting on and have some confidence that other implementors will interpret it in the same way as we have before we can vote "Yes".Comment on STREAM-ACCESS (Version 2, 30-Nov-88) Although requiring types instead of predicates forces the implementation of these streams as separate types, there is no obvious serious problem which can result from that, and it leaves open the possibility of writing methods on particular types -- if they are also classes -- are they? The proposal should spell this out. Having both the types and the predicates is unnecessary clutter. Omitting the predicates makes for less overhead with no lost functionality.Provision on STREAM-INFO (Version 6, 30-Nov-88) We vote "Yes" only if the name-changing amendment mentioned in the mail passes.	 Also, the writeup incorrectly states that Newline is not a standard character; Perhaps someone has confused "standard" with "graphic".Comment on SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE (Version 4, 07-Oct-88) Some minor worry about DECLARE-FUNCTION-AMBIGUITY here since the proposal mentions the list form of the FUNCTION declaration. This is a complicated issue and we have not had time to think it through as fully as we might like to have. Still, insofar as we have studied it, it looks ok.Provision on TAGBODY-CONTENTS (Version 5, 09-Dec-88) The term "data element" is too vague in paragraph 2 of the proposal. Our "Yes" vote is contingent on correcting this. Moon doesn't really like allowing ignored frobs other than expressions and tags, but is willing to live with the current proposal. There several typos which should be fixed.Comment on TAILP-NIL (Version 5, 09-Dec-88) The EQ -> EQL change at the last minute means this is not Genera current practice, contrary to the current practice section.Provision on TEST-NOT-IF-NOT (Version 2, 05-Oct-88) We are mostly happy with either of these proposals, with slight  preference to FLUSH-ALL. However, our "Yes" vote is contingent on:   - changing "remove" to "deprecate", and coming up with a     suitable policy for deprecation which allows a comfortable     transition from current practice.   - either of the FUNCTION-COMPOSITION proposals passing.Provision on TYPE-OF-UNDERCONSTRAINED (Version 3, 12-Dec-88) Our "Yes" vote is contingent on the following issues being addressed:  - RANDOM-STATE should be added to the list of built-in types.  - (subtypep (type-of x) (class-of x)) => T T for all x, seems to have    been intended but is not actually said. It should be added.  - The implementation recommendation in the discussion about returning    only portable type specifiers should be discarded.  - Shouldn't this refer to classes with proper names rather than just    ones with names?*start*08149 00024 USaReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 05 JAN 89 14:47:38 PSTReceived: from multimax.encore.com by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 5 Jan 89  13:12:53 PSTReceived: from mist.encore.COM by multimax.encore.com (5.59/25-eef)	id AA10957; Thu, 5 Jan 89 16:10:05 ESTReceived: from localhost by mist.

We hoped to make ithappen on a schedule like CLOS's schedule, but no one proposal killedoff the others fast enough.  We don't wish to holdup or even particularly complicate the work on the current standard,but we feel that something important has been accomplished:A single direction for iteration has come out.  I think the communitywants to know this.  X3J13 has the opportunity to give a boost to theevolution of Lisp by recognizing explicitly that this is *the*promising new style of iteration and encouraging its experimental use.Concerning your note, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it.For example, I have to guess as to its exact purpose.> As you recall, at the last X3J13 meeting Mathis commented that there would> be no subcommittee meetings in Hawaii . . .I don't recall, but I'm willing to assume that he made this comment.> . . . because this is the voting meeting,> and subcommittees would all be perforce making their final reports, at least> for the current version of the CL standard.I think you are trying to discourage the iterationsubcommittee from trying to do something that is out of line.It's not clear just what you are trying to discourage, though.Regarding these comments on their own merits, in a way I hate to dumpon them because we do need to push ourselves to finish up an officialCommon Lisp standard.  On the other hand it's hard to resist because Isee the rationale as containing a good deal of wrong conceptions, so:- Actually the cleanup committee has many issues still in the mill.- The compiler committee has the same difficulty, and in my opinion  some of the open issues are due to large holes in the definition of  Common Lisp.- The character set committee is at least not ready to have us vote.There are going to be more "voting" meetings and I feel confident therewill be significant discussion of issues.> If the iteration committee wants> to continue working for the next go-round, that's great, or maybe someone will> argue to keep the meetings going and the standard open for discussion.It's nice that you're glad to have us work for the next go-round.I hope you will be able to support us in being effective.*start*10400 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 JAN 89 22:31:29 PSTReceived: from EDDIE.MIT.EDU by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 9 Jan 89  22:30:41 PSTReceived: by EDDIE.MIT.EDU with UUCP with smail2.5 with sendmail-5.45/4.7 id <AA00602@EDDIE.MIT.EDU>; Tue, 10 Jan 89 01:28:10 ESTReceived: by spt.entity.com (smail2.5); 9 Jan 89 22:54:47 EST (Mon)To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduSubject: ballotMessage-Id: <8901092254.AA08704@spt.entity.com>Date: 9 Jan 89 22:54:47 EST (Mon)From: gz@spt.entity.com (Gail Zacharias)This ballot is the official position of Apple Computer."Yes if" means we won't vote for the proposal unless a condition is satisfied."Yes" with a comment means we'd like to see a change, but will vote for itanyway.Yes	ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIED:SPECIFY	Version 4, 21-Sep-88, Mailed 4 Dec 88Yes if	ARRAY-TYPE-ELEMENT-TYPE-SEMANTICS:UNIFY-UPGRADING	Version 9, 31-Oct-88, Mailed 5 Dec 88Flush the UPGRADED-xxx functions.Yes	CLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS:ALLOW-INQUIRY	Version 5,  5-Dec-88, Mailed 5 Dec 88Would prefer to specify a value for CLOSE on closed streams.

Because thesestream objects have dynamic extent, they cannot be referenced in any way oncethe WITH-xxx form exits.  (They can't even be passed to OPEN-STREAM-P.) As apractical example, the streams could be stack-consed, and future use couldcause crashes.  The reference to exited WITH-xxx forms should be deleted, orexplanatory text should be added.No	STREAM-INFO:ONE-DIMENSIONAL-FUNCTIONS	Version 6, 30-Nov-88, mailed 9 dec 88    	expect amendment:    		LINE-WIDTH   ==> STREAM-LINE-WIDTH    		LINE-POSITION ==> STREAM-LINE-POSITION    		PRINTED-WIDTH ==> STREAM-STRING-WIDTHOur opposition is based on the following points:1) The defining property of WRITE-SPACE (that it must write exactly the numberof units given) is too restrictive.  For example it may not be possible towrite whitespace to a stream in units smaller than a #\space character, if thestream is associated with a (multi-font) ascii file or editor buffer (sincethere may be no ascii character available that can be inserted in thefile/buffer to represent the whitespace).  An implementation cannot simplymake the unit size equal to the width of a #\space character, because asubsequent increase in font-size would again make the unit smaller than acurrent #\space character.2) The "additional properties" of PRINTED-WIDTH (i.e. 8 and 9, stating thatprinted-widths are additive) are incompatible with some non-Roman scripts. Forexample, in the Arabic language the glyphs used for characters are dependenton the surrounding characters: in our Arabic implementation of Object Logo,editing causes surrounding characters to change shape (and width) according totheir new context.  The restrictions on PRINTED-WIDTH would make it difficultto similarly incorporate the context-sensitive character portrayal features ofthe Macintosh into our Common Lisp implementation.3) In general we feel that the proposal is premature, given the current stateof i/o standards.  We would prefer to wait for a complete solution (i.e. areal graphics standard and extended characters set standard).  We feel thatthe current proposal is too specific and problematical for a proper place inCommon Lisp.  For now, the desired features are probably best obtained viaimplementation-specific functions.Yes	SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE:CLARIFY	Version 4,  7-Oct-88, mailed 7 Oct 88 Yes	SYMBOL-MACROLET-DECLARE:ALLOW	Version 2,  9-Dec-88, mailed 9 Dec 88Yes	SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS:SPECIAL-FORM	Version 5, 30-Nov-88, mailed 9 Dec 88Yes if	TAGBODY-CONTENTS:FORBID-EXTENSION	Version 5, 9-Dec-88 mailed 9 Dec 88We support forbidding extensions, but oppose allowing duplicate andunreachable tags.

We already asked for such approval at the June meeting inBoston (but "voting" got sidetracked).  One could say there has been widespread appeal for the "new forms" of iteration; but while thedesigns are still moving so fast, it hardly seems appropriate to bringthem back up to the committee as a whole now.  Interested parties have already been invited to join in the critique and discussions of the subcommittee.Also there was a very strong sentiment expressed at the Fairfax meetingthat we _not_ deluge the committee now with more proposals which are notready for voting on in January. [I'm already suffering information overload on all the new "last minute" Cl-cleanup proposals].I've asked for 30 minutes for the iteration committee report, expectingthat 5 or 10 minutes will be spent in reporting overall activity since the last meeting, and 20 minutes will be spent on discussion of the LOOP proposal.  That may turn out to be hopelessly optimistic for the time required for discussion, but I certainly don't intend to drag it out.Note that the "subcommittee reports" slots on the agenda are not for plenary design sessions.  As you have noticed, there is no time set aside at the Hawaii meetingfor subcommittee meetings.  This was by design, and was planned (andannounced) well in advance, so that we can reach some closure on theissues already before the main committee.  Since Larry has already taken the only available time slot for the cleanup subcommittee (Sundayafternoon/evening), I don't see how we can schedule a meaningfulIteration subcommittee meeting.  Those of us who will actually be therecould  probably make a better contribution by attending that meeting.-- JonL --*start*06659 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 JAN 89 23:36:18 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 9 Jan 89  23:35:48 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 09 JAN 89 23:34:40 PSTDate: 9 Jan 89 23:33 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: [chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.com: vote]To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890109-233440-5555@Xerox>     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----From: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comDate: 9 Jan 89 10:22To: masinter.paSubject: voteLarry, I thought I sent these to you, so if it's a repeat, justdiscard. Also, I grouped these issues loosely (but I didn't check them afterI grouped them, so some issues could be misplaced).

My response (since Jan was notaround to answer) was simply to point out what I thought was thewell-known fact that the Hawaii meeting has been long intended to be thelast major technical meeting with most decisions being made at or beforeit.  Therefore, subcommittee meetings are not necessary unless they are todecide how to run voting on topics.This wasn't meant to disparage the work of any subcommittee, but therehappen to be several that will not be able to contribute to the currentdraft standard.  If the iteration committee has hit upon *the* approach toiteration, that is wonderful, and maybe it is so wonderful that X3J13 willwant to leave the draft open until the iteration work is done. Similarly,the compiler and cleanup committees may not be able to get all of theirwork completed for incorporation into the current draft. The character setsubcommittee is possibly closer to a vote than Cris considers (at least, Ihope it is).But this is, alas, how natural selection works: The specimen dies beforeprogeny emerge.In any event, I meant simply to mention that it was long known that thismeeting was the ultimate decision-making meeting, but that I didn't seewhy X3J13 couldn't vote to overrule that. And however badly I said it,that's all I meant.			-rpg-*start*32622 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 10 JAN 89 00:42:32 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 10 Jan 89  00:39:32 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 10 JAN 89 00:38:20 PSTDate: 10 Jan 89 00:37 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Revised draft issue statusTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890110-003820-5607@Xerox>There are a number of people/organizations that have indicated that theyhave yet to send in their votes, so the "tally" isn't final.While it would be asking too much to have final drafts of all cleanupissues by next Monday, I'm hoping to print out, and bring copies of, theReady for release issues, and the expected amendments.

Must the    compiler preserve sharing of substructures?  CONSTANT-COLLAPSING (v5)    Should the compiler be allowed to "collapse" or coalesce constants    that satisfy a more general equivalence relationship than EQUAL?  QUOTE-MAY-COPY (v4)    May COMPILE and EVAL construct equivalent copies of quoted or     self-evaluating constants, or must constants share structure with    the source code for the program?  Do the constraints on what objects    are valid constants also apply to COMPILE and EVAL, or only to    COMPILE-FILE?  EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL (v4)    What does EVAL-WHEN mean when it appears in non-top-level locations?  DEFINING-MACROS-NON-TOP-LEVEL (v7)    Are defining macros such as DEFUN meaningful in non-top-level locations?  COMPILED-FUNCTION-REQUIREMENTS (v2)    What does the COMPILED-FUNCTION type imply?  Do COMPILE and     COMPILE-FILE construct COMPILED-FUNCTIONs?Other issues under discussion but not yet distributed:  COMPILER-LET-CONFUSION (v5)    The description of COMPILER-LET in CLtL is broken -- should we fix    it or eliminate it entirely?  MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-EXTENT (v1)    Do environment objects received as the &ENVIRONMENT argument to a     macro have dynamic or indefinite extent?  MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-CREATOR (v1)    How can code-walkers add the macro definitions in a MACROLET to    an environment object suitable for passing to MACROEXPAND?  DEFCONSTANT-NOT-WIRED (v5)    Add a way to declare a constant like DEFCONSTANT, but without giving     the compiler permission to "wire in" the value into compiled code.Issues where proposals have been submitted but not followed up on:  CONSTANT-ARRAY-ATTRIBUTES    What attributes of constant arrays are preserved by compilation?    Probably subsumed by CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES.  COMPILE-FILE-ENVIRONMENT    Clarify that macro environment objects contain information about    whether it was built by the compiler or interpreter.    Superseded by issue SYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS, unless that issue    has died.  DEFCONSTANT-VALUE    When is the value form to DEFCONSTANT evaluated?    Subsumed by issue COMPILE-FILE-HANDLING-OF-TOP-LEVEL-FORMS.  DEFINE-OPTIMIZER    Provide a macro-like way of specifying source-to-source transformations.    Waiting for revisions (Pitman)  FILE-COMPILATION    same issue as CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES?  PROCLAIM-ETC-IN-COMPILE-FILE    Are top-level calls to PROCLAIM handled specially by the compiler?    Waiting for resolution of related cleanup issues (DEFPACKAGE,    IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY)  SYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS    Provide accessors and constructors for lexical environment objects.    Waiting for new writeup (Benson)  WITH-COMPILATION-UNIT    Provide a way to compile a group of files as a unit for the purposes    of error messages.    Waiting for revisions to existing proposal (Pitman)-------*start*06404 00024 USaReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from

Lack ofthese semantics in Maclisp results in problems in Multics Emacs, whoseerror handler prints a minibuffer message and then throws to the toplevel, but if an error happens during a cleanup, the top-level catch isno longer available, resulting in an infinite loop of "throw tononexistent tag" errors.

There is nothing very like it in the rest    of CL, and it would make more sense to wait until the need for it    has been more firmly established.  I am also bothered by the use    of MACROLET.  Is it really the case that functions declared INLINE    would not be enough for optimization?Y   HASH-TABLE-STABILITY:KEY-TRANSFORM-RESTRICTIONS	Version 1, 11-Nov-88	, Mailed 12 Dec 88    I think this is an important clarification even though it may    not lead to extensive changes in practice.  I disagree with the    suggestions that the proposal be shortened; but if it cannot    gather enought support as-is, it might be rearranged so as to    stress issues of correct use, such as the effects of destructive    operations on keys.    Moreover, an explanation at this level of detail removes one of    the most common objections to allowing :test arguments outside    the standard set, if accompanied by appropriate key transformation    functions, namely that the necessary constraints must first be    understood.  It may therefore encourage implementors to provide    that extension, something I would like to see.Y   HASH-TABLE-TESTS:ADD-EQUALP	Version 2, 8-Dec-88, Mailed 8 Dec 88    It seems to me that SXHASH is not quite suitable for use with    EQUALP, and so I would like the key transformation function that    is used with EQUALP to made available to the user.Y   IN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY:SELECT-ONLY	Version 4, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88    At first I thought I'd make this conditional on DEFPACKAGE passing;    then I decided MAKE-PACKAGE would suffice.Y   LAMBDA-FORM:NEW-MACRO	Version 4, 22-Nov-88, Mailed 8-Dec-88Y   LCM-NO-ARGUMENTS:1	Version 1, 17 Oct 88, Mailed 8 Dec 88Y   LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION:DISALLOW	Version 5, 22-Nov-88, Mailed 8 Dec 88N   MAKE-PACKAGE-USE-DEFAULT:IMPLEMENTATION-DEPENDENT	Version 2, 8 Oct 88, Mailed 12-Dec-88    I would like any dependency on implementation-specific extensions    to be explicit.Y   MAPPING-DESTRUCTIVE-INTERACTION:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE	Version 2, 09-Jun-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88A   NTH-VALUE:ADD	Version 4, 8-Dec-88, Mailed 8 Dec 88    NTH-VALUE does not complete the set of operations on multiple values    because it extracts only one value, so I do not think it is needed    for the sake of completeness.Y   PACKAGE-CLUTTER:REDUCE	Version 6, 12-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-881A   PACKAGE-DELETION:NEW-FUNCTION	Version 5, 21 nov 88, Mailed 8 Dec 88Y   PATHNAME-TYPE-UNSPECIFIC:NEW-TOKEN	Version 1 27-Jun-88, Mailed 7 Oct 88    I can understand why someone might find the need for :UNSPECIFIC    in Unix unclear, but I think that is because it is not clear what    filenames would be parsed as pathnames with :UNSPECIFIC type [*];    :UNSPECIFIC is nonetheless useful for building pathnames directly    when you know which case you want and need a way to specify it.    [*] Does a name without "." parse as type NIL or :UNSPECIFIC?    Different Unix programs use different conventions.  Some are    willing to merge in a type field, others, such as the C compiler,    leave names as-is.  So the "right" answer may vary.    Y   PEEK-CHAR-READ-CHAR-ECHO:FIRST-READ-CHAR	Version 3, 8-Oct-88, Mailed 8 Oct 88Y   PRINT-CIRCLE-STRUCTURE:USER-FUNCTIONS-WORK	Version 3, 20 Sep 88, Mailed 8 Oct 88Y   PROCLAIM-LEXICAL:LG	Version 9, 8-Dec-88, Mailed 12-Dec-88    Under this proposal, special proclamations establish a default for    a name but, because of the lexical declaration, no longer force it    to be special everywhere.  It also allows the programmer to say    that a global name is intended as a variable (i.e., references to    it are not spelling mistakes) without proclaiming it special.  I    think these are important changes that should be preserved even if    this proposal fails.  Another important feature is that LG references    to global variables can be fast in deep-bound implementations (since    L "searches" can be compiled away) while DG references (the only    global variables we have now) first have to look in D.  Finally,    the current semantics are subtly confusing, because the specialness    of global variables occasionally shows through.  For all of these    reasons, I support this proposal.    I think the most controversial change is the introduction of a    separate global environment, where before the only globals were    effectively just the global end of the dynamic env.  Most of the    implementation complexity stems from this change, and it is likely    that it lies behind most objections.        A reasonable fallback, if this proposal does not pass, would be    to say that variables that are proclaimed lexical can never by    given dynamic bindings.  That is, the global value would be taken    after searching L or D but not both and so would effectively be    an extension of the L or D env, case by case.  This would be    somewhat unfortunate, because local lexical bindings for names    proclaimed special would still make sense (because they could be    declared lexical) but we wouldn't allow local special declarations    for names proclaimed lexical.  The full proposal is better.    Y   RANGE-OF-COUNT-KEYWORD:NIL-OR-INTEGER	Version 3, 9-Oct-88, Mailed 14-Oct-88Y   RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS:INTEGER-AND-INTEGER-NIL	Version 1, 14-Sep-88, Mailed 7 Oct 88A   REQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS:ELIMINATE	Version 6, 9 Dec 88, mailed 09 Dec 88N   REST-LIST-ALLOCATION:NEWLY-ALLOCATEDY   REST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MAY-SHAREN   REST-LIST-ALLOCATION:MUST-SHARE	Version 3, 12-Dec-88, mailed 12-Dec-88    NEWLY-ALLOCATED is cleanest, but may be too disruptive.Y   RETURN-VALUES-UNSPECIFIED:SPECIFY	Version 6,  9 Dec 88 mailed  9-Dec-88Y   ROOM-DEFAULT-ARGUMENT:NEW-VALUE	Version 1 12-Sep-88 mailed 8 Oct 88    I suppose we might, instead, allow anything other than T or NIL.    That has a bit of a ternary feel to it.    [The following are mutually exclusive]N   SETF-FUNCTION-VS-MACRO:SETF-FUNCTIONS	Version 3, 4-Nov-87, mailed Nov 87N   SETF-PLACES:ADD-SETF-FUNCTIONS	Version 1, 11-Nov-88, mailed 9-Dec-88    I am not yet happy with either proposal.  The first seems nicer    but complicates the semantics of CL at a rather central point    and introduces nonorthogonality by allowing (SETF name) in    FUNCTION but not as the car of a form.  The second looks like    a rather desperate attempt to avoid the first.  Is there some    way to avoid writing names like setf:3.bar.middle.ref in the    "local function" example?  (It's the 3 that looks worst.)Y   SETF-SUB-METHODS:DELAYED-ACCESS-STORES	Version 5, 12-Feb-88 mailed 8 Oct 88Y   STANDARD-INPUT-INITIAL-BINDING:DEFINED-CONTRACTS	Version 8, 8 Jul 88, Mailed 7 Oct 88Y   STEP-ENVIRONMENT:CURRENT	Version 3, 20-Jun-88, mailed  7 Oct 88Y   STREAM-ACCESS:ADD-TYPES-PREDICATES-ACCESSORS	version 2, 30-Nov-88 mailed  9 Dec 88	(expect amendment T ="true")    How many type names do not have corresponding predicates?Y   STREAM-INFO:ONE-DIMENSIONAL-FUNCTIONS	Version 6, 30-Nov-88, mailed 9 dec 88	expect amendment:		LINE-WIDTH   ==STREAM-LINE-WIDTH		LINE-POSITION ==STREAM-LINE-POSITION		PRINTED-WIDTH ==STREAM-STRING-WIDTHY   SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE:CLARIFY	Version 4,  7-Oct-88, mailed 7 Oct 88     If MEMBER, AND, OR, and NOT can be handled, I'd be happier if they    were handled.  This proposal is nonetheless better than the status quo.Y   SYMBOL-MACROLET-DECLARE:ALLOW	Version 2,  9-Dec-88, mailed 9 Dec 88    Goes best with DECLARE-TYPE-FREE:LEXICAL (rather than no DECLARE-    TYPE-FREE or :ALLOW).

DigitalPress would like to have it out this summer, and I think that would be theoptimal timing for it.  The purpose of a second edition is to provide theimplementation and user community with feedback on what X3J13 has done sofar, in a manner that links the committee's decisions with the currentstructure of CLtL.  (The eventual standard will be organized in acompletely different manner.)  This will provide a bridge between the firstedition of five years ago and the eventual standard (which may be anothertwo or more years away).  In addition, I will be adding commentary of myown about difficult places in the language, more examples, etc.  Forexample, I am attempting to explain nested backquotes so you can understandthem.  I also promise that the second edition will have a better index.The second edition will contain the entire contents of the first edition.New material will be distinguished from the old, and clearly marked as towhether it is the result of an X3J13 vote, an informal comment that came upin X3J13 meetings, or my own commentary.  The preface will containappropriate disclaimers, including that additional meetings and a publicreview period are yet to come, that X3J13 may reverse any decision at anytime, that X3J13 does not officially endorse the second edition, thatno member of X3J13 necessarily endorses what I write, and that where newexamples conflict with old material or with X3J13 votes, the new exampleshave lesser priority (I hope this doesn't occur!).I plan to include material on cleanups and compiler cleanups so far.  Iwould like to include the condition system and LOOP.  Dick Waters also oncespoke to me about including an appendix on OSS in order to publicize thisalternative approach to iteration; now that OSS and generators seem to beconverging, I'm not sure what would be appropriate, but am open tosuggestions.I do *not* plan to include any material about CLOS beyond a short overviewof five to ten pages, plus a few inserts describing such general featuresas PRINT-OBJECT and SYMBOL-MACROLET that impinge on the rest of thelanguage.  I will include pointers to CLOS chapters 1 and 2 as publishedin LASC and SIGPLAN Notices, and to Sonya Keene's book (I certainlycouldn't do any better than she did).I will be relying on work done by a lot of people, and I will be askingsome of you for very specific help in the next few weeks.  It seems to methat these many people ought to benefit from the royalties generated.I looked into various methods of compensation, but it became extremelycomplicated, both procedurally and legally, and there was always thdanger of overlooking someone.  I have turned instead to the notion ofdonating royalties toward some worthy cause(s) that would benefit theLisp community at large.  (This idea met with general informal approvalat the last X3J13 meeting when I announced it.)  I first looked intofinancing travel so that students could attend the coming Lisp andHistory of Lisp (LISPHOL) Conference; SIGPLAN has a fund for that purpose.It turns out that this fund is undersubscribed; SIGPLAN has more fundsthan applications, and David Wise urged me to look for some other project.Two more promising possibilities are underwriting some of the costsof making good historical records at LISPHOL, and donating funds toThe Computer Museum to establish a collection and perhaps exhibitson the History of Lisp.  I would be glad to receive other suggestionsfor appropriate projects.I hope to have a complete draft ready within several weeks.  I will besending a copy of this draft to every member of X3J13.  To be useful,feedback would be needed within a few weeks.  (Note that the new materialwill be distinguished by some typographical device such as lines in themargins, so you shouldn't have to read an entire 500-page draft!)  I willalso send a copy of the finished, published book to every member of X3J13once it is available, as well as to certain other persons who have madecontributions.--Guy*start*01701 00024 USaReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 23 JAN 89 14:34:08 PSTReceived: from cs.utah.edu by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 23 Jan 89  14:23:03 PSTReceived: from defun.utah.edu by cs.utah.edu (5.59/utah-2.1-cs)	id AA11470; Mon, 23 Jan 89 15:21:37 MSTReceived: by defun.utah.edu (5.59/utah-2.0-leaf)	id AA19082; Mon, 23 Jan 89 15:21:33 MSTFrom: sandra%defun@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Message-Id: <8901232221.AA19082@defun.utah.edu>Date: Mon, 23 Jan 89 15:21:32 MSTSubject: cl-compiler issuesTo: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduAt the Hawaii meeting, the following cl-compiler issues were passed:    ALLOW-LOCAL-INLINE    DEFCONSTANT-SPECIAL (amended)    LOAD-TIME-EVAL (amended)    SHARP-COMMA-CONFUSION    COMPILE-FILE-HANDLING-OF-TOP-LEVEL-FORMS (amended)    CONSTANT-MODIFICATIONCopies of these proposals (incorporating the amendments) are availablefor anonymous FTP from cs.utah.edu (that's 128.110.4.21), in directorycl-compiler/passed.

Larry, should they be writtenup as formal proposals, and if so, should they take the form of separateamendments, or should they consist of new versions of the old issues?--Guy(1) SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS did not address the question of how    symbol macros interact with *MACROEXPAND-HOOK*.  I propose that    expanding a symbol macro should result in calling the hook    function with three arguments, just as for an ordinary macro;    the first argument will be a special system-supplied expansion    function, the second argument the form (a symbol, of course),    and the third the environment.  The expansion function, when    called on the other two arguments, will return the expansion.(2) SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS should perhaps also specify that    PSETQ of a symbol-macro symbol behaves like PSETF.(3) The LOOP Facility has an inconsistency in its examples.    Under the description of WITH it shows the use of AND as	(LOOP WITH binding AND WITH binding AND WITH binding  body)    but in the discussion of destructuring an example reads	(LOOP WITH binding AND binding AND binding body)    The formal syntax for WITH prescribes that the word WITH should    *not* be reiterated (but note that the specification of    FOR/AS prescribes that FOR or AS *should* be written again--    possibly mixing them?)    I propose that, for consistency with FOR/AS, the formal syntax    of WITH be changed to require the word WITH to be reiterated,    and that the examples be changed to match.(4) SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE lists three rules:    * Involving SATISFIES, AND, OR, NOT, MEMBER allows return of NIL NIL,      but no other case does.    * Error if VALUES or FUNCTION involved.    * Must return T T if types EQUAL.    There are cases that fall into more than one of these categories,    and the proposal as approved did not specify a priority ordering    among them.    I happen to agree with the proposal of Kim Barrett to strike the    second point, although simply striking it is not enough.  I believe    that the first rule should take precedence over the third.    Therefore I propose that the three points above be condensed    simply to    * Involving SATISFIES, AND, OR, NOT, MEMBER, VALUES. or the list form      of FUNCTION allows return of NIL NIL; no other case may return NIL NIL.    Note that this wording subsumes the third point: if the second value    has to be T, then SUBTYPEP has to get it right, in which case EQUAL    type specifiers will produce T T.(5) TYPE-OF-UNDERCONSTRAINED has SINGLE-FLOAT and DOUBLE-FLOAT in its    list, but not SHORT-FLOAT or LONG-FLOAT.    I propose to add SHORT-FLOAT, LONG-FLOAT, and RATIONAL to the list.--Guy*start*00655 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 10 MAR 89 15:53:23 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 10 Mar 89  15:53:05 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 10 MAR 89 15:40:31 PSTDate: 10 Mar 89 15:38 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: (reply to message)In-reply-to: Guy Steele <gls@Think.COM>'s message of Fri, 10 Mar 89 18:22:09 ESTTo: Guy Steele <gls@Think.COM>cc: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890310-154031-16254@Xerox>I'd just as soon have them as new versions....*start*02779 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 11 MAR 89 14:52:27 PSTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 11 Mar 89  14:52:42 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 555177; Sat 11-Mar-89 17:50:15 ESTDate: Sat, 11 Mar 89 17:50 ESTFrom: David A.

This is already implied by the way CLtL describes PSETQ, butit's better to be explicit so the functionality is not accidentally lostduring editorial work to improve the wording ("x is just like y except"is not such a great way to write a standard).    (3) The LOOP Facility has an inconsistency in its examples.	Under the description of WITH it shows the use of AND as	    (LOOP WITH binding AND WITH binding AND WITH binding  body)	but in the discussion of destructuring an example reads	    (LOOP WITH binding AND binding AND binding body)	The formal syntax for WITH prescribes that the word WITH should	*not* be reiterated (but note that the specification of	FOR/AS prescribes that FOR or AS *should* be written again--	possibly mixing them?)	I propose that, for consistency with FOR/AS, the formal syntax	of WITH be changed to require the word WITH to be reiterated,	and that the examples be changed to match.The word should not be reiterated in either case.  I think this wasone of the many comments I offered on the LOOP proposal last year,but apparently it did not sink in.    (4) SUBTYPEP-TOO-VAGUE lists three rules....This is too complicated for me to offer a knee-jerk opinion.    (5) TYPE-OF-UNDERCONSTRAINED has SINGLE-FLOAT and DOUBLE-FLOAT in its	list, but not SHORT-FLOAT or LONG-FLOAT.	I propose to add SHORT-FLOAT, LONG-FLOAT, and RATIONAL to the list.I strongly agree.I'm glad -somebody- is double-checking already passed issues.

PSETQ is a macro which presumablyexpands into code which uses SETQ (assuming it doesn't expand into code whichuses an implementation-specific special form), which will then be transformedinto SETF.  MULTIPLE-VALUE-SETQ is similar.  Of course, it might be easier fora compiler to optimize a PSETF than the transformed PSETQ expansion.kab-------*start*01270 00024 US Return-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 13 MAR 89 07:20:24 PSTReceived: from cs.utah.edu by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 13 Mar 89  07:14:10 PSTReceived: from defun.utah.edu by cs.utah.edu (5.61/utah-2.1-cs)	id AA16287; Mon, 13 Mar 89 08:12:01 -0700Received: by defun.utah.edu (5.61/utah-2.0-leaf)	id AA02044; Mon, 13 Mar 89 08:11:59 -0700Date: Mon, 13 Mar 89 08:11:59 -0700From: sandra%defun@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Message-Id: <8903131511.AA02044@defun.utah.edu>To: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduReply-To: cl-compiler@sail.stanford.eduSubject: cl-compiler mailI will be sending out the remaining batch of cl-compiler issues today.I will also put FTP'able copies on host cs.utah.edu in directory~ftp/pub/cl-compiler/pending.

The general comments first:The cutoff dates question causes me some discomfort, and I thinkthat is because the proposal is not as explicit as it might be.First, how about stating what the goal for 12/89 is?  E.g. adraft standard approved by X3J13 and ready for release andoutside comments.Second, as I understand it, the "final changes" dates are forfinal changes from the selected reviewers for each section ofthe standard, though this is not stated.The process, as I understand it, is that a set of reviewers willread each section (or set of tool descriptions) carefully andsubmit corrections, etc..  The full committee will then vote onthese.A proper review will need to be done by subject rather than by sectionsof the alphabet.  In fact at least one person at Sun has volunteered towork on a particular subject.  Note that Moon expects Symbolicsinternal reviewers to do likewise.  To me that implies the catalog oftools must be voted on by subject rather than alphabetically, so Irecommend reorganizing those cutoff dates and votes by subject.Moon suggests that it will take "several months" for Symbolicsto review the draft standard, and that the availability ofthe cleanup process will be important for fixing problemsin the statement of the draft standard.  I second this.Being active in the compiler committee, I feel confident that awell-constructed section on compilation will *not* be ready by4/22/89.  We need to bring the compiler work to a conclusion as closeto that date as we can, though, even if all is not perfect.  The fullcommittee needs to help make this happen.  (Thanks especially to DavidMoon for his recent input.)ERROR-TERMINOLOGYThe error terminology is OK, except for "consequencesare unspecified".  That concept is broken, though ithas serious defenders.  For example, Dick Gabriel says,  "If we were to drop this term, then every time we are  ``explicitly vague'' a valid possibility is that a fatal  error can occur.  How is it any better to say that what happens  when some operation happens is ``explicitly vague''."A typical area of "explicit vagueness" is the destructive operationson lists.  The explicit vagueness here is quite limited.  Forsome operations any top level cell of certain lists may or maynot be modified.  Similar statements apply to other operations.The consequences are far from being unspecified but harmless.They are CONSTRAINED but meaningful.In other situations we may say that order of certain actionsis unspecified or we may say that a side effect may or may notoccur.  (For example, numerical operations may be performedin any of various orders.)  All of these are appropriate waysto state a specification.Maybe someone will make me suddenly see the light and I'll realizehow silly I've been, but so far the idea of consequences being"unspecified but harmless" seems more like a witticism thana useable idea.SECTION 6.1Under "Other Information", many of the terms are actuallytype specifiers.  Wouldn't it be better to say that if a nameis the same as a type specifier, that argument must satisfythe type specifier?  arguments to the function -- unclear to me    boolean -- I presume this are to be arguments where             all non-NIL values are *treated* alike.             Note that for macros we truly specify *syntax* (at leastfor some, e.g. defstruct.  For most functions we actuallygive a lambda list.p6-8, item 2b, the keyword :test-not has been flushed fromthe sequence functions.*start*02961 00024 US GV-Info: CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at 14-Mar-89 17:30:59 from AGReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 14 MAR 89 17:31:00 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 14 Mar 89  17:31:21 PSTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 14 MAR 89 15:36:44 PSTDate: 14 Mar 89 15:35 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: RE: Cleanup Issue StatusIn-reply-to: your message of Sun, 19 Feb 89 23:14:37 PSTTo: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comcc: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890314-153644-2132@Xerox>I have finally gotten around to reconciling your errata list from my statuslist.

Those of you in the US can expectto receive them on Monday or Tuesday via UPS, except for the three ofyou whose address is a P.O. Box, in which case you are at the mercy ofPriority SnailMail.  I don't know how long it will take forinternational delivery.To keep the costs down, where two persons were at the same address ororganization, I sent only one copy; for three or more I generally senttwo copies.  (In all I sent out 70 copies, at about 30 bucks eachincluding shipping.)KMP points out that it would be a serious mistake for everyone to dropeverything and start reading this draft, and I agree.  It is moreimportant to prepare for the upcoming meeting.  Furthermore, I wouldhate to see anyone burn out reading this less-than-authoritative draftof a less-than-authoritative book and then not have the energy to givethe draft standard a careful reading as well.You don't *have* to read it at all.  If you don't have the time, thenuse it as a doorstop, keep it as a souvenir, or give it to someonelike a graduate student.I will be grateful for any feedback I can get, of course.  I recommendthat you pay the most attention to my paraphrasing of and commentaryon issues with which you have been particularly involved, to make sureI didn't goof it up.  There is an index to the issues in the back thatmay be helpful.Some of the new material has nothing whatsoever to do with X3J13.You may wish to check out the I/O and Numbers chapters, for example.Digital Press will have a copy editor reading it for grammar andpunctuation, and I will be reading it carefully, so if your timeis limited you probably should concentrate on the conceptual level.I am especially interested in feedback of the form "You're going aboutthis all wrong.  Here's what you should do..."Don't worry at all about fonts, spacing, or number of pages.  What Ishipped to you today is merely 300-dots-per-inch draft quality withthe wrong fonts.  I am meeting next week with the book designer atDigital Press and we are going to work out what to do.  I also have alist of changes to make to my TeX macros that will systematicallyimprove the spacing and page break decisions.--Guy*start*19875 00024 US GV-Info: X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at 18-Mar-89 01:54:00 from AGReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 18 MAR 89 01:53:45 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 18 Mar 89  01:37:09 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 18 MAR 89 01:34:10 PSTDate: 18 Mar 89 01:33 PSTFrom: masinter.pato: X3J13@sail.stanford.eduSubject: The Cleanup Issue Status ListMessage-ID: <890318-013410-3635@Xerox>This is the complete list of Cleanup issues that are either:passed: passed at *any* previous meeting, including Jan 89pending: have been distributed for the March meetingin progress: might possibly be distributed for the March meeting,	or that I think are worth pursuing.Of course, some more might come up or be revived.I think I have updated versions of all pending and passedissues stored on arisia.xerox.com under the	clcleanup/pending	clcleanup/passeddirectories respectively.I'm pretty much unavailable (travelling, etc.) until the meeting.I'll try to read my mail while on the road, butit will be difficult to handle the quantity we'veseen in the last week.Codes:! released for Jan 89 meeting+ passed* need new version!*: released, but I know we'll need a new version+*: passed, but need to reconsider!*: passed, but need a new version to reconsider!+ ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENTVersion 4, 23-Nov-87Status: passed, 1988+ ADJUST-ARRAY-FILL-POINTER Version 1, 15-MAR-88Status: passed, 1988!

Gabriel and Gregor           are to submit a revised proposal.		No version arrived.Status: vote on 1?+ UNREAD-CHAR-AFTER-PEEK-CHARVersion 2, 2-Dec-88, Released 12-Dec-88Status: passed, Jan 89 X3J13+ VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRYVersion 3, 08-Oct-88, Released 9 Dec 88Status: passed, Jan 89 X3J13+ WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING-APPEND-STYLEVersion 5, 7-JUN-88 Status: Passed, 1988?*start*01289 00024 US GV-Info: franz!fridge!frisky!jkf@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU at 18-Mar-89 10:18:58 from AGReturn-Path: <franz!fridge!frisky!jkf@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU>Received: from ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU ([128.32.137.8]) by Xerox.COM ; 18 MAR 89 10:18:58 PSTReceived: from franz.UUCP by ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU (5.61/1.33)	id AA25443; Sat, 18 Mar 89 10:17:20 -0800Received: from fridge by franz (3.2/3.14)	id AA26640; Sat, 18 Mar 89 09:57:50 PSTReceived: from frisky by fridge (3.2/3.14)	id AA26688; Sat, 18 Mar 89 09:57:16 PSTReceived: by frisky (3.2/3.14)	id AA12805; Sat, 18 Mar 89 09:56:38 PSTFrom: franz!fridge!frisky!jkf@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU (John Foderaro)Return-Path: <frisky!jkf>Message-Id: <8903181756.AA12805@frisky>To: franz!ucbarpa!Xerox.COM!masinter.pa@ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDUSubject: Re: DEFAULT-CASE In-Reply-To: Your message of 17 Mar 89 21:25:00 PST.             <890317-212552-3367@Xerox> Date: Sat, 18 Mar 89 09:56:36 PST>> I'm going to unilaterally declare that this issue is not a "cleanup". Naturally I'm disappointed.

Larry offered to let anyone who wanted to read part of it.I believe we have to do better than that.  Right now, Larry and I arecompletely overcome with Common Lisp stuff.  It probably isn't anexaggeration to say that there are 1500 pages of stuff that we shouldbe reading now.So, I would like to start doing here what already happens elsewhere,namely to divide up some of this reading.  Larry and I can continue todo the X3J13 stuff for now, but it would be good to have other peoplelook at this draft of Steele.  This draft of Steele doesn't need thekind of micro analysis future drafts of it or the actual standard willneed, so it is a good place to start.  At some point in the future, wewill need some help reading official X3J13 stuff as well.If you want to help, please come by my office and pick up a chunk ofbook.  I have made multiple copies of the preface so everyone can getone of those with their chunk.We really do need help, so if not enough people come by I guess I willhave to seek you out.ThanksGregor-------*start*01048 00024 USaGV-Info: CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at 21-Mar-89 15:04:28 from AGReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 21 MAR 89 15:04:31 PSTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 21 Mar 89  15:02:53 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 562318; Tue 21-Mar-89 18:01:47 ESTDate: Tue, 21 Mar 89 18:01 ESTFrom: David A.

Opening Remarks.            The next meeting will be held Monday through Wednesday            March 27-29 at the Holiday Inn, Fair Oaks.  ISO will be            Thursday and Friday.            Chris Perdue will host the June meeting at the Hyatt Rickey            in Palo Alto, June 26-28.09:25am  Item 3, 4  Item 3.   Agenda            Items 11 and 20 were interchanged.  Item 4.   Minutes            The minutes of the last meeting were accepted.09:30am  Item 5  Item 5.   Other Business, Larry Masinter            Larry described the cleanup documents which were available for            distribution.  Hotel copying turned out to be too expensive            so copying was not done at the hotel.            The ISO meeting will be discussed tomorrow.  The committee            was asked if we were willing to give our draft to WG16 for            consideration and possible comments.  It was noted that no binding            vote can be taken at this meeting until the people not here can            raise objections.  All decisions should be summarized and            circulated before the next meeting.            Larry asked the status of the error committee.  Kent Pittman            considers the error committee's work over and therefore, he            considers the committee disbanded.  All requests for changes            would go to the cleanup committee.  Larry was concerned that            some substantial work still needed to be done and felt an            ad hoc committee was needed.  Bob Mathis said he should start            such a committee.  Larry is waiting for input from members.            Thom Linden has copies from ISO of working documents on calling            mechanisms and hang-independent data types.  He asked whether            there was any interest to expand this topic and begin a            subcommittee.09:50am  Item 6  Item 6.   Chapter 3 CLOS, Gregor Kiczales            A special issue of BIT with CLOS chapters 1 and 2 has just            come out.            Because of other committments, the subcommittee has not been            able to finish their work on chapter 3 and so it will not            be part of the standard.  Gregor said he will produce a            better version of 3 and will provide editorial feedback to            separate chapters 1 and 2 from forward references to 3.            The issue of chapter 3 will be brought up in March when            everyone has had two weeks to consider.            Sandra noted that the compiler subcommittee needs more feedback            from the CLOS subcommittee.10:25am  Item 20 Overview  Item 20.  Cleanup, Larry Masinter            Larry described the process for cleanup votes where issues            will be discussed in order of their controversy.10:30am  Coffee Break10:45am  Item 20 (continued)12:05pm  Lunch01:15pm  Item 20 (continued)03:00pm  Recess08:10pm  Item 10  Item 10.  Editorial Subcommittee, Kathy Chapman            Kathy raised the issue of conformance and extensions to the            standard.  There is an issue whether programs or implmentations            are conformable.  Barry moved and Gregor seconded to set a            cutoff date for discussion of conformance.  This motion passed.            A letter ballot will be sent out February 14th.  Gregor            asked that Kathy's letter summarizing and stating this            situation should include two writeups of a critical section            to show how the definition would affect the writeup.            Kathy has incorporated the condition proposal and CLOS chapters            1 and 2.  By June 20th, this document will be reviewed and            all comments incorporated.  After two years,  DEC is winding            down support of this work.            Dan Pierson moved and Jim Kempf seconded the deprecation            position.  This motion was passed.??

Iteration Subcommittee, Jonl White            Jonl moved and Jim Kempf seconded that Loop be added to the            language.  This motion passed 12-8.Tuesday, January 17, 198909:00am  Item 17, 18  Item 17.  Call to order.  Item 18.  Other Subcommittee reports            Jonl showed potential cleanup issues in Loop syntax.            Chris Perdue described new style iteration paradigms.  Dick            Waters has finished a portable version of the unified iterator.            He is now working on documentation.  His goal is to unify            SERIES and GENERATORS/GATHERERS and hopes for continued            interest from X3J13.  The code and specification will be            available.  The documentation may be available in the next            issue of the Steele book.  Jonl will prepare a paragraph            for that book on Loop which will emphasize its use as a matter            of style.            Sandra announced that the compiler subcommittee report            would be at 9am tomorrow after hard copy was available.            Guy Steele said that the 2nd edition of the Silver book will            be out in a few months.  It will include all of the last book            plus additional comments.  He is looking at using some of            the royalties to support the History of Lisp Conference or            the Computer Museum for acquiring History of Lisp objects.            A draft copy (600 pages) will be made available to anyone            willing to review the draft.  Everyone on X3J13 will get            a copy of the book.  The book will include the error and            iteration sections but will just have a pointer to CLOS.            Dick Gabriel will transfer all but X3J13 to Dave Loeffer            of MCC in the next month or two.  The archives will stay at SAIL.            Kathy Chapman announced an editorial subcommittee meeting            over lunch.            Dick discussed the ISO meeting and whether we should submit            our draft to WG16 if the US resolution to use CL as ISO does            not pass.  Dan Pierson moved and Sandra seconded to submit            our draft to ISO WG16.

Can we get together an hour before the main session to go over the cleanup report agenda? I want to order the cleanup issues so that we handle the "important" ones first. I roughly think that means:a) fix the cleanups that were previously brokenb) clarificationsc) changesc) additionswithin each category, order mainly by age: handle oldest issues first. But then, there are some of these that are more 'important' that we'll want to mess up the order. I plan to put together a proposal for dealing with these over the next few days and will mail it out, but you might want to come prepared with your own list of "things that are critically important to get voted on this meeting".*start*20512 00024 US GV-Info: CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at 23-Mar-89 16:43:12 from AGReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 23 MAR 89 16:42:59 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 23 Mar 89  15:33:50 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 23 MAR 89 13:44:52 PSTDate: 23 Mar 89 13:43 PSTFrom: masinter.pato: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduSubject: The Revised Cleanup Issue Status Listto: X3J13@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890323-134452-5540@Xerox>This is the revised (as of 23-Mar-89 13:43:08) complete list ofCleanup issues that are either:passed: passed at *any* previous meeting, including Jan 89pending: have been distributed for the March meetingin progress: might possibly be distributed for the March meeting,	or that I think are worth pursuing.Of course, some more might come up or be revived.I think I have updated versions of all pending and passedissues stored on arisia.xerox.com under the	clcleanup/pending	clcleanup/passeddirectories respectively.Codes:! released for Jan 89 meeting+ passed* need new version!*: released, but I know we'll need a new version+*: passed, but need to reconsider!*: passed, but need a new version to reconsider!+ ADJUST-ARRAY-DISPLACEMENTVersion 4, 23-Nov-87Status: passed, 1988+ ADJUST-ARRAY-FILL-POINTER Version 1, 15-MAR-88Status: passed, 1988!

Luckily there are 5 of us so I recycledthis one:	quinquevirate@sail.stanford.eduwith the archive file:	big5.msg[com,lsp]Some might not like the imperial tone of it all, but it's simplytoo much hassle to add another mailing list to the ones SAIL knowsabout already.Here is what ISO decided, which has implications for us:1. A draft of ANSI Common Lisp shall be delivered to the memberdelegations so as to arrive by July 31.2. The draft shall be accompanied by a document that outlines howX3J13 evaluates that draft. This is a rationale statement and shoulddiscuss those criteria we use for judging changes made to Common Lispand for judging the quality of the draft itself.3. Optionally, we can supply a document that outlines our constructivecriticism of an existing Lisp and its specification as an internationalstandard.In short, the German proposal was accepted and we are now in the processof selecting drafts/languages to possibly standardize. There is currentlysome question as to how many standards will be accepted, and I haveannounced to WG16 that the US will decide whether to submit both CommonLisp and Scheme or only Common Lisp based on our guess as to which of thepaths is most likely to result in an ISO Common Lisp.During discussions with Chailloux, he remarked that all he really wantedwas a core language that was a subset of both Common Lisp and LeLisp.This was news to me, and during further discussion it became clear that hewas technically confused about what a core language was and so explainedthe funny set of changes he proposed to Common Lisp in the so-called AFNORplan. I think defining a core of Common Lisp according to his intentionsis relatively simple, since it is a core language rather than anindependently useful dialect.I believe our charter includes the authority to make virtually anyeditorial decision and some minor technical decisions. The latter shouldbe almost entirely of the form of deriving conclusions from decisions madeby X3J13, but I can imagine making decisions about things that wereoverlooked. The largest decision I can imagine us making is a compromiseon the adjust-array question if that decision is consistent with existingpractice and all that has been decided by X3J13 already. (Actually, Idon't expect we will be able to make such a decision, but it is anexample. The key point is that I think we understood what was meant inKauai about the resolution that passed, but that resolution wastechnically flawed. We could clean up that resolution.)I plan to do some re-writing if that is acceptable. Right now I am willingto rewrite the history section and the sections on conditions. I am alsowilling to edit those other sections where my reviews outline a lot ofproblems. I think we should do this by a checkout mechanism where KC isthe locking device.  That is, we should ask her to check out a file orgroup of files, and when we are done, should be have the authority tocompare our version with the older one and to merge them as she sees fit.				-rpg-*start*03046 00024 US Date:  3 Apr 89 14:13 PDTSender: X3J13-mailer%SAIL.Stanford:EDU:XeroxFrom: sandra%defun%cs.utah:EDU:XeroxSubject: compiler issuesTo: x3j13%sail.stanford:EDU:XeroxGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVFrom: sandra%defun@cs.utah.edu (Sandra J Loosemore)Subject: compiler issuesTo: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 03 APR 89 12:42:25 PDTReceived: from cs.utah.edu by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 3 Apr 89  12:31:06 PDTReceived: from defun.utah.edu by cs.utah.edu (5.61/utah-2.1-cs)	id AA18809; Mon, 3 Apr 89 13:31:05 -0600Received: by defun.utah.edu (5.61/utah-2.0-leaf)	id AA18372; Mon, 3 Apr 89 13:31:02 -0600Message-Id: <8904031931.AA18372@defun.utah.edu>Original-Date: Mon, 3 Apr 89 13:31:01 MDTGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVHere is what happened to the various compiler issues that weredistributed prior to last week's meeting.  The issues that were passedwill show up on cs.utah.edu in the ~ftp/pub/cl-compiler/passeddirectory within the next day or two (all of the amendments werefairly trivial this time).  Further discussion on the issues that weretabled will happen on the cl-compiler mailing list.CLOS-MACRO-COMPILATION  Tabled for consideration of amendment.COMPILE-ENVIRONMENT-CONSISTENCY   Tabled for consideration of amendment.COMPILE-FILE-SYMBOL-HANDLING   We agreed to consider only some variant of proposal REQUIRE-CONSISTENCY.  Some people are unhappy with the restrictions on placement of   IN-PACKAGE and would like this fixed.  Tabled so we can produce a new proposal.COMPILED-FUNCTION-REQUIREMENTS  A straw vote showed most people want to retain the COMPILED-FUNCTION  type.  Proposal TIGHTEN had the most support, but some people wanted it  only to apply to COMPILE-FILE and not COMPILE.    Tabled so we can produce a new proposal.COMPILER-DIAGNOSTICS  Proposal USE-HANDLER passed with amendment.COMPILER-LET-CONFUSION  Proposal ELIMINATE passed.COMPILER-VERBOSITY  Proposal LIKE-LOAD passed.CONSTANT-CIRCULAR-COMPILATION  Proposal YES passed.CONSTANT-COLLAPSING  Proposal GENERALIZE passed.CONSTANT-COMPILABLE-TYPES  Proposal SPECIFY passed with amendment.CONSTANT-FUNCTION-COMPILATION  Tabled so we can produce new proposals.DEFINE-OPTIMIZER  Proposal NEW-FACILITY failed.DEFINING-MACROS-NON-TOP-LEVEL  Proposal ALLOW passed.EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL  Proposal GENERALIZE-EVAL-NEW-KEYWORDS passed.LOAD-TIME-EVAL  Proposal R**3-NEW-SPECIAL-FORM passed.MACRO-CACHING  Tabled so we can simplify the writeup.MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-EXTENT  Proposal DYNAMIC passed.PROCLAIM-ETC-IN-COMPILE-FILE  Proposals YES and NO were eliminated.

I had chosen to send outindividual messages because I assumed most people like myself who weredoing per-topic filing would find that simpler. But for those who arejust auditing this stuff and deleting it, here's my summary.Just a reminder though -- these are just my notes and do not necessarilyrepresent the official story if it turns out there are discrepancies.-----ADJUST-ARRAY-NOT-ADJUSTABLE - DeferredBREAK-ON-WARNINGS-OBSOLETE - PassedCLOS-CONDITIONS - PassedCLOS-MACRO-COMPILATION - TabledCLOSED-STREAM-OPERATIONS - Motion to replace v7 with v5 passed unamendedCOERCE-INCOMPLETE - WithdrawnCOMMON-TYPE - PassedCOMPLEX-RATIONAL-RESULT - PassedCONDITION-RESTARTS - DeferredCOPY-SYMBOL-COPY-PLIST - PassedCOPY-SYMBOL-COPY-PRINT-NAME - PassedDECLARE-FUNCTION-AMBIGUITY -  An incredibly weird vote on the question ``How many favor saying it passed at the last meeting?'' passed N-0-M.DEFINE-OPTIMIZER - Failed There is new information which leads me to believe this might come up again at the next meeting.DEFMACRO-LAMBDA-LIST - There were hardcopy amendments distributed. My notes say that we approved amendments A & B (``permit all four'') and we added an amendment that said that &ENVIRONMENT would not be duplicated in a DEFMACRO lambda-list. The amended proposal was passed N-0-1.DESCRIBE-UNDERSPECIFIED -  An amendment was made (I think by Barrett) to make DESCRIBE deal with  its second argument in the same way as PRINT does (that is, permitting arguments of NIL and T). The amended proposal passed 15-0.DESTRUCTURING-BIND Discussion on this was broken over two days with quite a number of possible amendments discussed.  Pitman came up with a written set of amendments for Thursday which were discarded because Moon submitted a revised proposal (consistent with those amendments, and adding at least one other feature not covered in those separate amendments) on Thursday. The revised proposal was v3, already mailed. Moon's revised proposal was voted on, and passed 15-1.DYNAMIC-EXTENT -  Steele and Pitman drafted a revised proposal over lunch Thursday which passed 17-0.EQUALP-GENERIC - WithdrawnERROR-CHECKING-IN-NUMBERS-CHAPTER - DeferredERROR-NOT-HANDLED - Withdrawn in favor of providing Kathy with editorial advice to `minimize implicit requirements on debuggers' in the presentation of the debugger in the standard.EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL - Option GENERALIZE-EVAL-NEW-KEYWORDS passedEXIT-EXTENT -  Moon offered some amendments the effect of which were to allow you to throw again to the same tag as you were already throwing to; specifically: In the first paragraph of the MINIMAL proposal, delete "or is itself the target exit" and change "events (c) and (d) at" to "event (c) occurs at". After the first paragraph add a new paragraph "The event (d) occurs at the end of the transfer of control." The proposal was amended, and the amended option MINIMAL passed 11-5.FUNCTION-COERCE-TIME -  Withdrawn; editors were instructed to be explicitly vague 16-1.FUNCTION-NAME -  The net effect is that option LARGE passed with amendments to strike 7,8,9.GENSYM-NAME-STICKINESS - PassedHASH-TABLE-ACCESS -  Passed 17-0 with hand-written amendments by Pitman (and agreement that the `obvious' write-o's would be corrected).HASH-TABLE-SIZE - DeferredIN-PACKAGE-FUNCTIONALITY -  The net effect is that NEW-MACRO passed with the name of SELECT-PACKAGE changed to IN-PACKAGE.IN-SYNTAX - Version 2, which makes LOAD and *COMPILE-FILE* bind *READTABLE* (and which does -not- introduce the IN-SYNTAX macro mentioned in version 1) passed 12-0-3.  This version was distributed by KMP in handwritten form.LISP-PACKAGE-NAME -  The net effect is that this passed with amendment to rename package USER to  COMMON-LISP-USER with nickname CL-USER.LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION -  GZ wanted an amendment to strike item 8 from this list. Sandra had some concern about the penultimate paragraph where she wanted a prohibition on the ability to trace local functions (in implementations that permit that).  Moon thinks the proposal was amended to explicitly allow tracing of such local function bindings. We went round in circles about item 8.  A straw poll to send this back for more work failed 6-10, so we kept on. A motion was made to terminate discussion. This passed by 2/3 vote. Moon's notes say item 8 may need further refinement, as for instance by GLS's amendment.  The goal is to separate properties into the ones the user can bash and the ones the user cannot bash. Ultimately, I have written in my notes that we voted on   ``proposal replaced by RPG, item 8 struck, w/ Sandra's prohibition     to trace local functions'' and that it passed 14-3. Item 8 might be revisited at the next meeting.LOAD-OBJECTS - Moon proposed friendly amendment to use the name MAKE-LOAD-FORM-SAVING-SLOTS. The amended proposal passed 18-0.LOAD-TRUENAME - DeferredLOCALLY-TOP-LEVEL - PassedLOOP-AND-DISCREPANCY - PassedMACRO-CACHING - Tabled Tuesday. Not re-raised Thursday. Might or might not come up at next meeting.MACRO-ENVIRONMENT-EXTENT - option DYNAMIC passed 15-1.MAKE-STRING-FILL-POINTER - WithdrawnPACKAGE-FUNCTION-CONSISTENCY -  This was on the agenda but not discussed. I expect it will come up at the next meeting.PATHNAME-CANONICAL-TYPE - DeferredPATHNAME-COMPONENT-CASE - DeferredPATHNAME-COMPONENT-VALUE - DeferredPATHNAME-LOGICAL - Deferred (but not seriously expected to come up again)PATHNAME-PRINT-READ -  This was deferred from Tuesday to Thursday but then didn't come around for discussion due to lack of time. It might come up at the next meeting.PATHNAME-SUBDIRECTORY-LIST - DeferredPATHNAME-SYNTAX-ERROR-TIME - DeferredPATHNAME-WILD - DeferredPEEK-CHAR-READ-CHAR-ECHO -  Kim Barrett mentioned again that he wants to reopen this, but nothing was done.PRETTY-PRINT-INTERFACE - DeferredPRINT-CASE-PRINT-ESCAPE-INTERACTION -  This was deferred from Tuesday to Thursday but then didn't come up for discussion. Being a clarification, I expect it to come up at the next meeting.PRINT-CIRCLE-SHARED - This was deferred from Tuesday to Thursday but then didn't come up for discussion. Since some people consider this almost a clarification, this might come up at the next meeting.PROCLAIM-LEXICAL - FailedREAD-CASE-SENSITIVITY - DeferredREAD-DELIMITED-LIST-EOF - This issue was mentioned but was not on my list of possible topics. No action was taken. It's probably a clarification and I guess it might still come up later.REAL-NUMBER-TYPE - Passed (the `union' of the two proposals)REMF-DESTRUCTION-UNSPECIFIED - PassedREQUIRE-PATHNAME-DEFAULTS -  Reconsidered but no change made. Previous vote stands.SETF-MULTIPLE-STORE-VARIABLES -  This was on the agenda but never gotten to. I think it might come up at the next meeting.SYMBOL-MACROLET-SEMANTICS - Version 6 passed.SYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS - DeferredTHE-AMBIGUITY - This didn't come up. Being a clarification, I assume it might come up next meeting.TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER Moon proposed time zones be multiples of 1/3600 so that they were even numbers of seconds.  (Some people suspected this was a subtle marketing ploy for Symbolics.) This amendment was accepted 11-0. Pitman proposed that we limit time zone to the range [-24,24], inclusive. The inclusive was to allow countries to disagree on which end was open, since it was agreed that the correct value here is a largely political, rather than technical issue.  The amendment was accepted 8-5. The full proposal with both amendments passed 18-0.TYPE-OF-UNDERCONSTRAINED -  Some people had some concerns about a previous version of this that passed. We wanted to reconsider this, but didn't have the right hardcopy. No action was taken. This will probably come up next meeting.UNDEFINED-VARIABLES-AND-FUNCTIONS - DeferredWITH-COMPILATION-UNIT - This passed 11-6 with an amendment to say it defers "warnings" rather than "actions" and with an amendment to say it does not apply to the COMPILE function (only to  COMPILE-FILE).*start*02491 00024 US GV-Info: X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at  6-Apr-89 12:55:16 from AGReturn-Path: <X3J13-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Received: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 06 APR 89 12:32:02 PDTReceived: from lucid.com by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 6 Apr 89  12:20:27 PDTReceived: from challenger ([192.9.200.17]) by heavens-gate.lucid.com id AA01519g; Thu, 6 Apr 89 12:14:36 PDTReceived: by challenger id AA04159g; Thu, 6 Apr 89 12:09:45 PDTDate: Thu, 6 Apr 89 12:09:45 PDTFrom: Jan Zubkoff <jlz@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8904061909.AA04159@challenger>To: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduSubject: June 26 - 28 meeting, Palo Alto, CASUBCOMMITTEE MEETINGS:DATE: 6/25PLACE: TBA IF NECESSARYCOMMITTEE MEETING:DATES: 6/26 - 6/28TIME: 9:00 - 5:00CITY: Palo AltoPLACE: Rickey's HyattROOM: Executive Conference RoomADDRESS: 4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA 94306 REGISTRATION FEE: $80   Payable to: LUCID, Inc.HOTEL ACCOMODATIONS: HOTEL: Rickey's HyattADDRESS: 4219 El Camino Real, Palo Alto, CA 94306 PHONE: 800/228-9000 or 415/493-8000 RATE: $110/nightMENTION: "X3J13" for rateDIRECTIONS from airport:From SFO: Take 101 south to San Antonio Road (about 25 minutes in non-rushhour traffic).

Following is the list of issues that I had marked "tabled" from the    Jan. meeting and that haven't come up again. I just wondered what    happened to them.

I don't	   claim to understand what he really means. Maybe he's wondering if it's	   ok to omit the word "TYPE" in any user-defined type declaration.	   If he means that, I think it's a bad idea because DEFTYPE allows the	   introduction of type names which would conflict with basic declarations.	   Maybe LISP-SYMBOL-REDEFINITION and/or PACKAGE-CLUTTER makes this concern	   a non-issue, though.	 ========================================I don't know what led me to believe it was Withdrawn. Often I mark who "withdrew"it but for some reason I didn't here. Anyway, since Larry introduced it and sinceLarry is not now pushing it, I assume it will fall by the wayside. Correct me ifI'm wrong, but I assume that CLtL is not ambiguous. This was effectively a featurerequest, and apparently not a popular one. ======================================== DEFMACRO-BODY-LEXICAL-ENVIRONMENT (no proposal)  Author:   none  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Tabled  Summary:  What is the lexical environment of DEFTYPE, DEFINE-SETF bodies?  Comments: ----- Pitman 06-Oct-88 -----	    I couldn't find any record of this proposal.	    Larry says it was deferred to Compiler Committee.	    Probably it was renamed. ========================================In my positions file, I use the term "Tabled" to mean something different thanwhat Robert's Rules say. I use it to mean "not being pursued because somethingelse came along to take its place". Probably at this point the label I have isinaccurate and "Subsumed by <some `passed' issue>" is the right thing.I believe this issue was covered by EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL, orsomething else. Anyway, I don't think this fell through the cracks -- Ithink it was just resolved under another cover. ======================================== FILE-WRITE-DATE-IF-NOT-EXISTS (no proposal)  Author:   none  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Pending  Summary:  What does file-write-date do if no such file?  Comments: ----- Pitman 05-Oct-88 -----	    I think this never got written in hopes the Errors committee would	    deal with it, but the Errors committee didn't see it as part of its	    contract.	    ----- Pitman 20-Mar-89 -----	    No mail since Oct-88.  I may yet get to this, but no one should hold	    their breath. ========================================At this point, I believe this is properly part of an effort similar toERROR-CHECKING-IN-NUMBERS-CHAPTER. If I get to doing an ERROR-CHECKING-IN-FILE-CHAPTER, this will get taken care of as part of that.Probably I will ultimately get to that, so probably it will not fall throughthe cracks, but for now it is being ignored. ======================================== LET-TOP-LEVEL (Version 1, 01-Mar-88)  Author:   Pitman  Forum:    Cleanup -> Compiler  Status:   Tabled (Cleanup)	    Subsumed by DEFINING-MACROS-NON-TOP-LEVEL and EVAL-WHEN-NON-TOP-LEVEL (Compiler)  Comments: ----- Pitman 06-Oct-88 -----	    Deferred to Compiler Committee.	    The suggestion of allowing specifically LET and not other forms	    seems fairly arbitrary. I would rather see a more general theory	    of DEFUN accepting the current lexical environment. In fact, I	    see no reason for DEFUN to have to work just at "toplevel" anyway... ========================================As the `Status' notes suggest, this has indeed been dealt with. ======================================== PROMPT-FOR (Version 1, 11-Mar-87)  Author:   Pitman  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Tabled  Comments: ----- Pitman 04-Oct-88 -----	    Some of the Xerox poeple didn't find this proposal to be adequately	    well motivated. Moon wants it to look more like ACCEPT.	    This is waiting for me or someone to submit a rewrite. ========================================At this point, I think it's appropriate to consider this withdrawn. It wouldhave been a good idea, but is a feature request for which there is too littlesupport to try to squeeze in after the deadline. ======================================== SPECIAL-VARIABLE-TEST (Version 2, 21-May-88)  Author:   Pitman  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Released  Comments: ----- Pitman 09-Oct-88 -----	    Looks ok. ========================================In spite of what it says there, this is really tabled in hopes thatSYNTACTIC-ENVIRONMENT-ACCESS will pass. If that proposal does notultimately pass, this should be reactivated because it providesimportant user-requested functionality. ======================================== STANDARD-VALUE (Version 1, 21-Oct-88)  Author:   Pitman  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Released  Comments: ----- Pitman 24-Oct-88 -----	    Masinter had some current practice.	    He also thinks the wording pins us to a particular style of debugger	    that we probably shouldn't be forcing. ========================================This is probably too elaborate to bother trying to get in at this time.I consider it withdrawn because the feature freeze has been passed. ======================================== STREAM-CAPABILITIES (Version 1, 05-Jul-88)  Author:   Pierson  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Active?  Comments: ----- Pitman 09-Oct-88 -----	    This is a mess. Perhaps we should strip it down to just	    deal with interactive-stream-p.	    ----- Pitman 27-Mar-89 -----	    There's been more mail but my feelings are the same.	    Maybe this has been given up on. -kmp ========================================Since we are beyond the feature freeze, I don't expect much action onthis unless someone gets really ambitious and strips it down to somethingreally bare bones that is clearly non-controversial enough to arouse people'sinterest even after the feature deadline. I don't think that's likely. ======================================== STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE-EXAMPLES (Version 1, 26-Oct-88)  Author:   Rosenking  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Tabled?  Summary:  If you open a stream with element type BIT, can STREAM-ELEMENT-TYPE	    later yield (INTEGER 0 1)?  Comments: ----- Pitman 13-Nov-88 -----	    This might be legit issue but isn't something we can vote on in	    its current state. 	    ----- Pitman 26-Mar-89 -----	    No new mail traffic to date. ========================================This being a clarification kind of thing, you might yet expect to getsome advice on how to clarify it if someone gets ambitious, but I see noevidence that anyone is moving on this right now. ======================================== SYMBOL-MACROFLET (Version 1, 30-Sep-88)  Author:   Pitman  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Tabled  Comments: ----- Pitman 06-Oct-88 -----	    The problem of using FLET in its place is a real one, but I don't know	    what to do. This needs to be re-thought a bit and re-submitted.	    Moon expressed mild support, though. ========================================It's a damned shame we didn't move on this before the feature freeze time.It's really important to be able to implement certain portable facilitieswith known efficiency, but I didn't see much recognition of that.Unfortunately, FLET provides equivalent semantic capability to what's askedfor here, so some people think it's redundant. But the fact is that FLETis not usefully efficient because it is too hard to reliably compile optimally,while this is much simpler to compile correctly. So this is something of awar between pragmatists and purists.I might still push this, but it would be an upward battle, so don't fret too much. ======================================== TRUENAME-SYNTAX-ONLY (Version 1, 12-Sep-88)  Author:   Sandra Loosemore  Forum:    Cleanup  Status:   Active  Comments: ----- Pitman 06-Oct-88 -----	    The evolution of this looked to be proceeding ok with interchanges	    between Moon and Sandra, but Sandra felt "bogged down" and wanted	    to withdraw this.	    ----- Pitman 26-Mar-89 -----	    No interesting mail traffic since last entry.	    Masinter thinks this is part of the general collection of 	    `pathname issues.' ========================================Since it's still open season on pathname issues, this might still bedealt with.  Unfortunately, Moon scared off Sandra and she's not stillpushing it even though I think it's something she still wishes she had.This could still happen.Hope this has been helpful. -kmp*start*01574 00024 US Date:  4 Apr 89 08:48 PDTSender: CL-Cleanup-mailer%SAIL.Stanford:EDU:XeroxFrom: KMP%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics:COM:XeroxSubject: Issue: DEFINE-OPTIMIZERTo: CL-Cleanup%SAIL.Stanford:EDU:XeroxGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Issue: DEFINE-OPTIMIZERTo: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EDUReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 04 APR 89 08:44:59 PDTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 4 Apr 89  08:42:28 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 570934; Tue 4-Apr-89 11:42:22 EDTOriginal-Date: Tue, 4 Apr 89 11:41 EDTMessage-ID: <890404114158.6.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>GVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVAfter some fooling around with various amendments, this was brought toa vote with the names DEFINE-COMPILER-MACRO (and I guess COMPILER-MACROEXPAND and COMPILER-MACROEXPAND-1, though I realized laterthat it was never made explicit) and failed 8-11-0.I believe the issue may get re-opened.

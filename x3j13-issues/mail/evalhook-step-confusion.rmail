Problem Description:

Common Lisp permits the evaluator to be implemented by compiling the
form before executing it, but notes that this techniques "renders the
EVALHOOK mechanism relatively useless" (CLtL p. 321).

CLtL also requires the STEP utility to be implemented in terms of
EVALHOOK (p. 323).  The restriction against implementing STEP using
some other technique (such as annotations on code lexically within the
body of the STEP) that make more sense in a compiled-only
implementation is pointless.  It is probably not even desirable for
STEP to be implemented with *EVALHOOK*, since this effectively causes
the stepper to break on user programs that also use *EVALHOOK*.


Proposal (EVALHOOK-STEP-CONFUSION:FIX):

(1) Clarify that there is no guarantee that the functions that are the
values of *EVALHOOK* and *APPLYHOOK* will ever be invoked during
evaluation.

(2) Remove the requirement that STEP be implemented using *EVALHOOK*.
Make it explicitly vague whether the scope of the code that is affected
by STEP is lexical or dynamic.

(3) Deprecate *EVALHOOK*, *APPLYHOOK*, EVALHOOK, and APPLYHOOK.


Rationale:

Point by point:

(1) This is merely an explicit statement of the status quo.

(2) This permits compiled-only implementations to support a STEP
utility that does something useful.

(3) The eval hook mechanism is a relic of a particular interpreter
implementation technique and really has no place in a language
standard, especially since one of the stated goals of the language is
consistency between compiled and interpreted code.  Since there is no
guarantee that these functions will ever be invoked, portable programs
should not rely on them.



Current Practice:

According to Kent Pitman:
  I'm told by the guys who did the Cloe implementation that indeed
  neither evalhook nor step do much of anything useful.  If I understood
  them correctly, *evalhook* just never gets called, and step works by a
  different mechanism that may work at a granularity different than what
  people expect.

Loosemore has been implementing an evaluator for Utah Common Lisp that
uses a preprocessor to partially compile programs.  The interpreter
for the processed code does support the use of an *evalhook*-like
special variable, but the information it is passed is in a different
format than that which *evalhook* requires.  In particular, the object
representing the lexical environment contains only bindings and not
syntactic information such as macro definitions.  It also supports a
variety of annotation-based program debugging hooks that are specified
by declarations.  We are in the process of integrating the
preprocessor into the UCL compiler so that most of these debugging
hooks will also work in compiled code.


Cost to implementors:

None.


Cost to users:

None.


Benefits:

Users will not be misled into thinking *evalhook* is more portable
than it actually is.

Compiled-only implementations can make STEP do something reasonable.


Discussion:

There is an article by Parker in Lisp Pointers, Vol 1 #4 which
describes one approach for annotation-based debugging.  Loosemore's
PhD dissertation (soon to be available as a UofU Tech Report) also
discusses alternate approaches for implementing program steppers.

Scott Fahlman says:
  I am staying out of most of these discussions, but thought I'd throw in my
  two cents' worth on this one: I would very much like to see evalhook and
  applyhook removed from the standard.  They have been a constant source of
  confusion, and there are so many different interpretations of what these
  hooks do that facilities built on top of them are not really very portable
  in practice.  I'm now convinced that a really good stepping package cannot
  easily be written using these hooks, but must be integrated into the
  interpreter of a given implementation.

David Moon says:
  Seems okay, except that if we are going to deprecate these things,
  I would much rather just remove them.  You would surely argue that
  no significant program could possibly be depending on EVALHOOK,
  since it has no semantics, so there can't be a compatibility issue.
  If we agree that something is a bad idea, I would rather remove it
  entirely unless there is a compelling compatibility reason to only
  deprecate it.  In fact even if some programs used EVALHOOK, I would
  still want to remove it, as I long ago ceased to believe in any
  fantasy of seamless compatibility between CLtL and ANSI CL.  But
  others might not agree with me there.

  Plus if we remove them, Symbolics doesn't have to fix the bug that
  EVALHOOK and APPLYHOOK accidentally got declared SPECIAL.  I mention
  this only as an example of the costs of deprecating things instead
  of removing them.  They have to be maintained.  Not only do they have
  to be documented, but in addition to documenting them we have to tell
  people not to use them.

Loosemore says:
  I'd rather get rid of these things entirely too, but I have previously
  noted some resistance to the idea from others.  Maybe they've changed
  their minds by now.  Anyway, if we can't agree to delete them now, 
  deprecation is better than the current situation.

I have some questions about how EVALHOOK is supposed to work in
implementations whose evaluators compile (or partially compile) forms
passed to EVAL.  Page 321 of CLtL says that this technique "renders
the EVALHOOK mechanism relatively useless".  Does this mean it's
possible that the *EVALHOOK* function might never be called by EVAL?
Or, might the form argument it receives be some kind of structure
representing the source code, instead of the Lisp source code itself? 

Also, page 323 says that "the STEP facility is implemented using this
hook".  Is this really a *requirement* on the implementation of STEP,
or just a suggestion on how it *might* be implemented?

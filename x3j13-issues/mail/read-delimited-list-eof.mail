I think you might be proposing to change an "is an error" in CLtL into a "signals an error"; if so, you might consider specifying the class of error signalled.*start*01149 00024 US Date:  4 Apr 89 12:49 PDTSender: CL-Cleanup-mailer%SAIL.Stanford:EDU:XeroxFrom: KMP%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics:COM:XeroxSubject: Issue: READ-DELIMITED-LIST-EOFTo: CL-Cleanup%SAIL.Stanford:EDU:XeroxGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Issue: READ-DELIMITED-LIST-EOFTo: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EDUReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 04 APR 89 12:41:19 PDTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 4 Apr 89  12:38:46 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 571265; Tue 4-Apr-89 15:38:36 EDTOriginal-Date: Tue, 4 Apr 89 15:38 EDTMessage-ID: <890404153809.2.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>GVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVGVThis issue was mentioned but was not on my list of possible topics.No action was taken.Since it's probably a clarification (?) and I assume it might stillcome up later.*start*02270 00024 US GV-Info: CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at  9-Apr-89 23:33:21 from AGReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 09 APR 89 23:33:23 PDTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 9 Apr 89  23:32:26 PDTReceived: from Salvador.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 09 APR 89 23:32:26 PDTDate: 9 Apr 89 23:31 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Issue: READ-DELIMITED-LIST-EOFTo: KMP@symbolics.comcc: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduMessage-ID: <890409-233226-3497@Xerox>This is what I have filed under "READ-DELIMITED-LIST-EOF".I think this could well be handled under ERROR-CHECKING-IN-IO-CHAPTERS orsome such.     ----- Begin Forwarded Messages -----Date: Mon, 28 Nov 88 17:17 ESTFrom: Barry Margolin <barmar@Think.COM>Subject: EOF during READ-DELIMITED-LISTTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduAccording to CLtL p.378, "it is always an error to hit end-of-fileduring the operation of READ-DELIMITED-LIST."

I always assumed that it was justan oversight that page 158 doesn't mention that FUNCTION is an exceptionto the list in table 4-1 since the next page gives it a different meaning.Are there any implementations that actually try to support it both ways?Actually, now that I think about it, both forms could be supported sincethere isn't really any ambiguity -- in one case the third element of thedeclaration specifier must be a list and in the other it must be a non-nilsymbol if present.> Proposal (FUNCTION-DECLARATION:DELETE)> > The declaration (FUNCTION name argtypes valtypes) is no longer permitted> to be an abbreviation for (FTYPE (FUNCTION argtypes valtypes) name).> > The declaration (FUNCTION var1 var2) would just be an abbreviation for> (TYPE FUNCTION var1 var2).Maybe this would have been cleaner, but I don't see sufficientjustification for making an incompatible change now.> Current Practice:> > VAX LISP treats FUNCTION declarations as describing only function bindings.I'm not quite sure which you mean; do you mean it only supports the (FUNCTION name argtypes valtypes) form?  The Explorer only supports thisone.> Cost to Users:> > Existing uses of the FUNCTION declaration for function bindings will need> to be changed to FTYPE declarations.  Such code could not have been portable,> though.That last sentence is not true, since CLtL clearly says that it is allowedand defines what it means, so no valid implementation can disallow it.*start*01733 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 22 SEP 88 22:11:51 PDTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 22 Sep 88  22:11:31 PDTReceived: from Cabernet.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 22 SEP 88 22:09:26 PDTDate: 22 Sep 88 22:09 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: Issue: DECLARE-FUNCTION-AMBIGUITY (version 1)In-reply-to: David N Gray <Gray@DSG.csc.ti.com>'s message of Thu, 22 Sep 88 10:34:17 CDTTo: David N Gray <Gray@DSG.csc.ti.com>cc: vanroggen%aitg.DEC@DECWRL.DEC.COM, cl-cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <880922-220926-3835@Xerox>(I thought I had sent out mail asking to please rename this issue.. fromFUNCTION-DECLARATION?)I think the major motivation for this for me is that the FUNCTION-TYPE proposal,adopted at the last meeting, now makes (DECLARE (TYPE FUNCTION a b c))meaningful where it was not before (or certainly no compiler that I know ofcould take advantage of a declaration that var1 was either a symbol or afunction object.)Now that (DECLARE (TYPE FUNCTION a b c)) is meaningful, the use of (DECLARE(FUNCTION a b c))  now might seem ambiguous, since it could mean(DECLARE (FTYPE (FUNCTION b c) a))or(DECLARE (TYPE FUNCTION a b c ))The only simple way of disambiguating between these is that in the firstinterpretation, b must be a list, while in the second, b must be a symbol.(Declaring NIL to be a function is an error, so it should be treated as a list.)I'm having trouble coming up with an example that is a real ambiguity.

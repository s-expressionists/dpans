This makes   them virtually useless. I would like to constrain the values   enough so that implementors knew what to provide as return   values, and provide some examples of intended uses."Status: need volunteer to submitI don't have much to say on this issue and cannot find message from which Iexcerpted the quote. Who is the "I" here? Do you want to submit a proposal?

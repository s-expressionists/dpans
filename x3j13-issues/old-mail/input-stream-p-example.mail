As for the question, "How can a broadcast stream be INPUT-STREAM-P?", the pointis that it CAN'T, though the Symbolics implementation evaluates to T.As per the Lisp implementations that I have referenced, when I have referredto the MAC, VAX and Symbolics Lisps I more specifically was referencing theAllegro CL 1.1, Vax Lisp V2.2, and Symbolics Genera 7.2 versions.

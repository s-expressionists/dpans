The reason for my commenting was tonotify or query others that various implementations, specifically Allegro Coral for the Mac and Genera 7.2 on Symbolics and possiblyothers, differ when evaluating   (output-stream-p (make-concatenated-stream))If this is only the case on the Symbolics, which returns T for the aboveexpression, then it is their bug. I proposed an alternative examplewhich also demonstrates the functionality of output-stream-p, as it is defined in CLtL, and which works in at least the two implementationsspecified.

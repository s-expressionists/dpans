However,the current PARSE-INTEGER doesn't say NIL is supposed to mean anything,so I think this would be a change in the functionality.  So anothercleanup item would be appropriate.  You might want to generalize andtalk about the uses of all the normal "sequence" keyword arguments.For example, I don't think CLtL says that the predicates and :key'smay get called any number of times in any order, except when describingSEARCH.  I think that should be stated for all the sequence functions.			---Walter*start*03474 00024 US Return-Path: <chapman%37.975.DEC@decwrl.dec.com>Received: from decwrl.dec.com ([128.45.9.1]) by Xerox.COM ; 19 SEP 88 07:11:35 PDTReceived: by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.5/4.7.34)	id AA03505; Mon, 19 Sep 88 07:11:29 PDTDate: Mon, 19 Sep 88 07:11:29 PDTMessage-Id: <8809191411.AA03505@decwrl.dec.com>From: chapman%37.975.DEC@decwrl.dec.comTo: masinter.paSubject: ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIEDIssue:        ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIEDReferences:   LOGBITP (p 224), MAKE-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER (p 363), 	      MAKE-HASH-TABLE (p 283), MAKE-SEQUENCE (p 249), READ (p 375)     	      MAKE-STRING (p 302), NTHCDR (p 267), PARSE-INTEGER (p 381),	      SET (p 92)Category:     CLARIFICATIONEdit history: 26-Aug-88, Version 1 by Chapman	      4-Sep-88, version 2 by Masinter	      19-Sept-88, Version 3 by Chapman Problem Description: The descriptions of LOGBITP, MAKE-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER, READ, SET,MAKE-HASH-TABLE, MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAKE-STRING, NTHCDR, and PARSE-INTEGER are not clear about the types of the arguments supplied to these constructs. Proposal (ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIED:SPECIFY) Clarify that the arguments for the listed constructs are as follows: Construct			Argument	TypeLOGBITP 			index		non-negative integerMAKE-DISPATCH-MACRO-CHARACTER 	char		characterMAKE-HASH-TABLE			size	 	non-negative integerMAKE-SEQUENCE	     		size		non-negative integerMAKE-SEQUENCE	     		type		type specifierMAKE-STRING			size            non-negative integerMAKE-STRING			initial-element	string-charNTHCDR 				n		non-negative integerPARSE-INTEGER 			start,end       non-negative integersPARSE-INTEGER 			start,end       non-negative integersSET-SYNTAX-FROM-CHAR		to-char,from-char						charactersREAD and others			eof-value	any valueSET				value		any value (MAKE-HASH-TABLE, MAKE-SEQUENCE, MAKE-STRING have additional constraints ontheir respective SIZE arguments; for example, MAKE-STRING may detect an error ifSIZE is greater than or equal to ARRAY-DIMENSION-LIMIT.

PARSE-INTEGER maydetectan error if the START or END arguments are  not in the range of the "string"argument.) Rationale: This clarification allows predictible results to occur when arguments are supplied to these constructs. Current Practice: Cost to Implementors: None, since this is consistent with current practice. Cost to Users:None, since this is consistent with current practice. Benefits: This clarification will assist users in writing portable code. Aesthetics: The standard would be less clean were the allowed ranges of its functions notspecified. Discussion:KMP believes the END argument to PARSE-INTEGER should be permitted to beNIL, meaning use the rest of the string.  This is most convenient froman implementation point of view because one can write  &KEY (START 0) (END NIL) If you say the argument must be an integer, you must write:  &KEY (START 0) (END NIL END-P) and complain if END is NIL while END-P is T (which seems gratuitouserror checking since the functionality would be useful) or else you mustdo  &KEY (START 0) (END (LENGTH STRING)) which is also gratuitous since the function will not be certain that thevalue of END is correct and will have to do (LENGTH STRING) yet again inorder to validate the value of END. KMP believe an analogous criterion should be applied to END argumentsacross the board. and is writing this upas a separate cleanup item. Van Roggen concurs. ========================================================================Received: by decwrl.dec.com (5.54.5/4.7.34)	id AA03720; Mon, 19 Sep 88 07:13:18 PDT*start*01206 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 20 SEP 88 19:11:05 PDTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 20 Sep 88  19:09:29 PDTReceived: from GRYPHON.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 462874; Tue 20-Sep-88 22:07:55 EDTDate: Tue, 20 Sep 88 22:07 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Issue: ARGUMENTS-UNDERSPECIFIED (Version 3)To: chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comcc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EDUIn-Reply-To: <8809200106.AA05432@decwrl.dec.com>,             <8809191413.AA03664@decwrl.dec.com>Message-ID: <880920220739.4.KMP@GRYPHON.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Since there is now a proposal on the table for dealing with START andEND arguments, why not just strike all wording in this proposal whichdeals with those arguments.

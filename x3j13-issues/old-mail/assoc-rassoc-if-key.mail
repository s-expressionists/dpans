Status:       For Internal Discussion

Problem Description:

  The descriptions of ASSOC-IF, ASSOC-IF-NOT, RASSOC-IF, and RASSOC-IF-NOT
  do not mention a :KEY option.

Proposal (ASSOC-RASSOC-IF-KEY:YES):

  Allow a :KEY keyword for ASSOC-IF, ASSOC-IF-NOT, RASSOC-IF, and RASSOC-IF-NOT.
  If not supplied, it should default to #'IDENTITY as do the :KEY keywords
  for other -IF and -IF-NOT functions.

Rationale:

  All the other -IF and -IF-NOT variations of list operations omit the
  :TEST and :TEST-NOT keywords, but allow :KEY. For example, consider
  the family of MEMBER, MEMBER-IF, and MEMBER-IF-NOT. The omission of
  :KEY in this situation in CLtL was probably an oversight.

Current Practice:

  The Symbolics implementation went ahead and added :KEY.
  I suspect that implementations are split down the middle on
  whether this is offered.

Adoption Cost:

  A small amount of additional code is necessary to support this in 
  implementations not already offering it as an extension.

Benefits:

  This would make the set of -IF and -IF-NOT functions be more regular in
  their calling conventions.

Conversion Cost:

  The change is essentially upward compatible with user code.

Aesthetics:

  Although this introduces additional mechanism, it does so in a way that
  probably makes it easier to think about which functions do what, so it
  would likely be seen as a simplification.

Discussion:

  KMP supports this change/clarification.

I think the reason that ASSOC-IF, RASSOC-IF and friends do not have :KEY
arguments is that  ASSOC-IF is equivalent to FIND-IF :KEY #'CAR and
RASSOC-IF is FIND-IF :KEY #'CDR. That is, the way I think of these
functions, they already have a KEY argument, it is just that the KEY is
already implicitly specified by the function name.

I don't see any substantial advantage of expressiveness in this
proposal.

I've been unable to find any other implementation (outside of symbolics)
that has ASSOC-IF-KEY.  I looked at Spice, Xerox and VaxLisp. I'm uneasy
saying that the others are "split down the middle" if they aren't. 


I tried to generate a test case. Can you think of something more
illuminating than

(ASSOC-IF #'ZEROP '(("ABC" . 3) ("E"  . 4) ("" . 7)) :KEY #'LENGTH)

  => ("" . 7)

    that has ASSOC-IF-KEY.  I looked at Spice, Xerox and VaxLisp. I'm uneasy
    saying that the others are "split down the middle" if they aren't. 

I think I didn't have access to other lisps in order to try it on the day
I sent that message. If none of the other lisps you know do it, then I'm
happy to say under current practice that only we are known to have implemented
the extension.

    I tried to generate a test case. Can you think of something more
    illuminating than

    (ASSOC-IF #'ZEROP '(("ABC" . 3) ("E"  . 4) ("" . 7)) :KEY #'LENGTH)

      => ("" . 7)

Well, I don't like to think of a non-accessor as the :KEY, though this
is technically fine.  We should probably give some advice about this in
the sample cleanup template; my feeling is that the test case just has
to illustrate the feature, not motivate it. Under this criterion, the
case above is fine.

The problem with a simple test case is that the need for this only comes up
in real program situations where objects with structured parts appear in
alists. In that case, you might have something like:

(DEFSTRUCT FOO X)
(ASSOC-IF #'IDENTITY '((#S(FOO :X NIL) 3 4) (#S(FOO :X T) 7)) :KEY #'FOO-X)

or

(ASSOC-IF #'PROBE-FILE '((#S(FOO :X "FOO.LSP") 3 4) (#S(FOO :X "BAR.LSP") 7))
	  :KEY #'FOO-X)

for that matter. In a real program, the #S(...) forms would presumably not be
constant -- they'd be pushed on by programs calling constructors -- and this
latter example doesn't return a constant value across implementations, but it
hopefully gives you a sense of what you can do. Another case might be:

(DEFVAR *KNOWN-PACKAGES* (MAPCAR #'FIND-PACKAGE '("LISP" "KEYWORD")))

(DEFUN KNOWN-PACKAGE-P (PACKAGE) (MEMBER PACKAGE *KNOWN-PACKAGES*))

(ASSOC-IF #'KNOWN-PACKAGE-P '((FROB . FUNCTION) (IF . SPECIAL-FORM))
	  :KEY #'SYMBOL-PACKAGE)
 => (IF . SPECIAL-FORM)

A situation that seems most familiar to me takes more work to set up:

(DEFUN FULL-DIRECTORY-LIST (WILD-PATHNAME)
  "Returns (wild-path (path1 :WRITE-DATE date1 :AUTHOR author1) ...)."
  (LET* ((PATHS (DIRECTORY WILD-PATHNAME))
         (DATES   (MAPCAR #'FILE-WRITE-DATE PATHS))
	 (AUTHORS (MAPCAR #'FILE-WRITE-DATE PATHS)))
    (CONS FILES
	  (MAPCAR #'(LAMBDA (PATH DATE AUTHOR)
		      (LIST PATH :WRITE-DATE DATE :AUTHOR AUTHOR))
		  PATHS DATES AUTHORS))))

In this case, you could imagine a variety of ASSOC-type operations that you
might want to do on the pathname in the car of each list in the cdr of the
result. In general, it's true that you can always write:

(ASSOC-IF #'(LAMBDA (P) (MEMBER (PATHNAME-TYPE P) '("LSP" "L" "LISP")
			     :TEST #'STRING-EQUAL))
	  (CDR DIRECTORY-LISTING))

but somehow I find it more aesthetic to see:

(ASSOC-IF #'(LAMBDA (TYPE) (MEMBER TYPE '("LSP" "LISP" "L")))
	  (CDR DIRECTORY-LISTING)
	  :KEY #'PATHNAME-TYPE)

so that the key extraction and the predication are separate. This increases
the likelihood that the function in the predicate position will already exist
with some known name. For example, going back to your original example,
there is no function which does (ZEROP (LENGTH x)) but there are functions
ZEROP and LENGTH which work together well in the place where :KEY is provided.

Feel free to extract any part of this message that moves you and add it to
the proposal if you feel it's warranted. Doubtless this text is too long
and rambly to be included as a whole.

Just wishful thinking, I think. My records show only 4 messages on this

I don't know if this was discussed before, so please excuse the possible
repetition.  According to CLtL (pp 279-281), assoc permits the keyword
:key, but neither assoc-if nor assoc-if-not allow it (same for rassoc,
rassoc-if, and rassoc-if-not).  Franz Common Lisp and Xerox Common Lisp
follow the book and permit :key for just assoc (and rassoc), while KCL and
TI Explorer don't allow :key at all.

I think it should not be allowed at all since assoc lists are defined
as pairs such that the keys are the cars of the respective pairs, not
some function of the respective cars.  In any event, there should certainly
not be an inconsistency.

    I think it should not be allowed at all since assoc lists are defined
    as pairs such that the keys are the cars of the respective pairs, not
    some function of the respective cars.  In any event, there should certainly
    not be an inconsistency.

I think this is because an "Association list" is poorly defined.  It
appears to be historically defined.  A better definition of the CLtL'84
intent might be that the car /contains/ the key of the association, and
by default the car /is/ the key of the association.

I agree it does appear to be inconsistent (with FIND, COUNT and
POSITION) that ASSOC-IF doesn't take a :KEY argument.

The Cleanup subcommittee of X3J13 has addressed this issue, but apparently
it's on hold right now while higher priority things are attended to, although
the proposal really just needs some editorial work before it's presented to
X3J13.

My own opinion is that the -if and -if-not ones should take keys also.

Example:

(assoc-if #'zerop pathnames :key #'pathname-version)

could be used to search a list indexed by pathnames finding one
with zero version. 

Rationale:

This is an inconsistency in the language which is simple to fix.

Current Practice:

Symbolics implements :KEY for the -IF and -IF-NOT assoc functions.
Franz and Xerox follow the book. TI Explorer doe not allow :KEY at all.

Cost to Common Lisp implementors:

A small amount of additional code is necessary to support this in

    As penance for having dropped this simple issue, I offer you version 2.
    I moved some of the discussion around, added a (not very good) example.
    This issue sports the new "Cost to implementors" and "Cost to users" section
    headings. 

Small clarification.  To you only; all others removed.

	...
    Proposal (ASSOC-RASSOC-IF-KEY:YES):

    Allow a :KEY keyword for ASSOC-IF, ASSOC-IF-NOT, RASSOC-IF, and RASSOC-IF-NOT.
    If not supplied, it should default to #'IDENTITY as do the :KEY keywords
    for other -IF and -IF-NOT functions. The function, as with the :KEY argument
    for ASSOC and RASSOC, are applied to the CAR of the pair in the association
    list.

The :KEY argument for RASSOC should be applied to the CDR.  The last
sentence above implies the :KEY argument is applied to the CAR for both
ASSOC and RASSOC.

Problem Description:

The descriptions of ASSOC-IF, ASSOC-IF-NOT, RASSOC-IF, and RASSOC-IF-NOT
do not mention a :KEY option, although ASSOC and RASSOC have one.

Proposal (ASSOC-RASSOC-IF-KEY:YES):

Allow a :KEY keyword for ASSOC-IF, ASSOC-IF-NOT, RASSOC-IF, and RASSOC-IF-NOT.
If not supplied, it should default to #'IDENTITY as do the :KEY keywords
for other -IF and -IF-NOT functions. The function, as with the :KEY argument
for ASSOC and RASSOC, are applied to the CAR of the pair in the association
list for ASSOC-IF and ASSOC-IF-NOT and the CDR of the pair for RASSOC-IF and
RASSOC-IF-NOT.

Documentation impact:

A better description of the intent might be to say that the car /contains/
the key of the association, and by default the car /is/ the key of the
association.

Example:

(assoc-if #'zerop pathnames :key #'pathname-version)

could be used to search a list indexed by pathnames finding one
with zero version. 

Rationale:

This is an inconsistency in the language which is simple to fix.

Current Practice:

Symbolics implements :KEY for the -IF and -IF-NOT assoc functions.
Franz and Xerox follow the book. TI Explorer doe not allow :KEY at all.

Cost to Common Lisp implementors:

A small amount of additional code is necessary to support this in 
implementations not already offering it as an extension.

Cost to Common Lisp users:

The change is essentially upward compatible with user code.

Benefits:

This would make the set of -IF and -IF-NOT functions be more regular in
their calling conventions.

Aesthetics:

All the other -IF and -IF-NOT variations of list operations omit the
:TEST and :TEST-NOT keywords, but allow :KEY. For example, consider
the family of MEMBER, MEMBER-IF, and MEMBER-IF-NOT. 
Although this introduces additional mechanism, it does so in a way that
probably makes it easier to think about which functions do what, so it
would likely be seen as a simplification.

Discussion:

The omission of :KEY in this situation in CLtL was probably an
oversight.

The cleanup committee supports this change/clarification.

On your Explorer, you are probably either using Zetalisp or you are
running with very old software (Release 2).  The Common-Lisp ASSOC
in Release 3.0 of the Explorer follows CLtL and allows for a :KEY arg.

I agree, but I think all of the ASSOC functions should accept a :KEY
arg.  Alists are commonly used in Lisp.  Of the following, the ASSOC-IF
version is much easier to read.

;;ALIST is an alist where the CAR's are objects (eg persons)
(assoc-if #'over-the-hill-p alist :key #'age)
(find-if #'over-the-hill-p alist :key #'(lambda (x) (age (car x))))

Since alists are in common use, and it would make the ASSOC functions
consistent with FIND et al, the ASSOC functions should also accept :KEY
args.

I should know better than to take a second-hand report on current practice.
I removed the mention of TI. In response to a private message, I changed
 a which to that (or was it a that to a which). Whichever thatever was,
I fixed it, lest this turn into another which-hunt.
Given the amount of mail on the Common Lisp mailing list, I felt justified
in saying that this was often reported as an inconsistency... at least it
makes it sound like a problem.

I was proposing to make that vagueness apparentso it wouldn't be a time bomb in some people's code.A few more thoughts for what they're worth... - CLtL (and Kathy's current draft manual) describes INSPECT as an interactive   version of DESCRIBE. That doesn't quite contractually oblige DESCRIBE to be   non-interactive, but it does provide an interesting perspective on intent. - Another way to go is to provide an argument saying whether it was ok   to ask questions:	DESCRIBE thing &OPTIONAL (query-ok (INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P *STANDARD-OUTPUT*))	 where QUERY-OK would default according to the interactiveness of the	 stream in question   or	DESCRIBE thing &KEY (verbose :QUERY)	 where VERBOSE might be one of T, NIL, or :QUERY - If people are going to be writing CLOS methods for DESCRIBE, we better get   started early in saying whether they ought to be incorporating queries into   their code. [Interestingly, though, the CLOS spec requires the methods for   DESCRIBE to be compatible with CLtL's description of DESCRIBE, not the   emerging ANSI spec's description. :-]*start*01224 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([10.0.0.11]) by Xerox.COM ; 14 SEP 88 22:07:52 PDTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 14 Sep 88  22:07:39 PDTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 14 SEP 88 21:52:51 PDTDate: 14 Sep 88 21:53 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: Issue: DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE (Version 1)In-reply-to: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>'s message of Tue, 13 Sep 88 12:32 EDTTo: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.STANFORD.EDUMessage-ID: <880914-215251-1875@Xerox>The description of DESCRIBE says that it prints something on *standard-output*,just like PRINT.

I believe they should, but I don't feel that the    DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:NO proposal is necessary to allow them    to do so. ...I certainly think your intermediate proposal might be the right way togloss this messy issue with a minimum of incompatible change, but whilewe're on the subject I feel I should point out that the issue ofinteractive and the issue of batch, while strongly [inversely]correlated in practice are not necessarily so strongly correlated in theabstract. You could have batch applications which work on the terminal,or even non-batch situations where it was important to see the output ofDESCRIBE without needing intervention.  The most irritating case is onewhere the query gets asked on a window for which there is no way toselect the window to type to. Similarly, you could have situations wheredata was going to a file and the query were still appropriate. So noticingthe interactiveness of the stream is one that is statistically less likelyto lead to trouble, but it is not, strictly, a real solution to the problem.I keep falling back to what somebody once called "pitman's two-bit rule"of language design -- it goes something like: if you have two bits ofinfo to represent, use at least two bits to do the representation. Sinceinteractiveness of the input argument and need for query are potentiallyorthogonal, you can't get away with passing only one argument and usingit for both purposes without running into trouble some of the time. Amore robust solution would add a :DETAILED or :VERBOSE option toDESCRIBE, which could be T, NIL, or :ASK.*start*01160 00024 USaReturn-Path: <@multimax.ARPA:pierson%mist@multimax.ARPA>Received: from multimax.ARPA ([192.5.63.14]) by Xerox.COM ; 01 NOV 88 07:08:47 PSTReceived:  by multimax.ARPA (5.51/25-eef)	id AA26493; Tue, 1 Nov 88 10:06:43 ESTReceived: from localhost by mist.UUCP (3.2/4.7)	id AA29890; Tue, 1 Nov 88 10:10:39 ESTMessage-Id: <8811011510.AA29890@mist.UUCP>To: masinter.pa%Xerox.COM@MULTIMAX.ENCORE.COMCc: Moon%STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM@MULTIMAX.ENCORE.COMSubject: Re: Issue: DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE (Version 3) In-Reply-To: Your message of 31 Oct 88 11:19:00 -0800.             <881031-112022-6051@Xerox> Date: Tue, 01 Nov 88 10:10:36 ESTFrom: Dan L.

Are alternatives reasonably considered?David Moon has suggested that (a) the writeup does not explicitly state the point of view that this is an incompatible change and that the Rationale is not compelling enough. and (b) there is an alternative, which is to require implementations for which DESCRIBE might be interactive to only be interactive when DESCRIBEing things to "interactive" streams. I think both points are reasonable. Your response did not address them. Certainly it is a matter of opinion about whether the Rationale given justifies an incompatible change to an existing implementation. However, it is a matter of fact whether the discussion contains the range of strongly held opinions within the cleanup committee; in this case, it does not.I'm less sure how we could adopt a proposal which would allow DESCRIBE to be interactive on interactive streams and restrict it to be non-interactive on non-interactive streams until we had defined what an "interactive" stream was, which we seem to have had some trouble doing. However, it is an interesting compromise position. Certainly you wouldn't want (with-output-to-string (*standard-output* )(describe y ))to be interactive while (let((*standard-output* *terminal-io*)) (describe y))might as well be. *start*06719 00024 USfReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 15 NOV 88 14:16:06 PSTReceived: from multimax.encore.com by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 15 Nov 88  14:11:36 PSTReceived: from mist.encore.COM by multimax.encore.com (5.59/25-eef)	id AA00481; Tue, 15 Nov 88 17:10:25 ESTReceived: from localhost by mist.UUCP (3.2/4.7)	id AA07001; Tue, 15 Nov 88 17:14:19 ESTMessage-Id: <8811152214.AA07001@mist.UUCP>To: cl-cleanup%sail.stanford.edu@Multimax.encore.comSubject: Issue: DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE (Version 4)Date: Tue, 15 Nov 88 17:14:16 ESTFrom: Dan L.

In some implementations it is,   and in other implementations it is not.  Users of systems in which DESCRIBE is not interactive may presume  that it is safe to call DESCRIBE in a batch applications without  hanging the application, which can lead to problems.Proposal (DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE):    Specify that DESCRIBE is permitted (though not required) to    require user input, and that such input should be negotiated    through *QUERY-IO*.    Descriptive information would continue to go to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.  Test Case:    The following kind of interaction would be permissible in    implementations which chose to do it:     (DEFVAR *MY-TABLE* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE))     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOO *MY-TABLE*) 1)     (SETF (GETHASH 'BAR *MY-TABLE*) 2)     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOOBAR *MY-TABLE*) 3)     (DESCRIBE *MY-TABLE*)     #<EQ-HASH-TABLE 259> has 3 entries.     Do you want to see its contents? (Yes or No) Yes  Rationale:    This validates current implementations.  Current Practice:    Symbolics Genera asks some questions interactively when describing    some kinds of structured data structures, such as hash tables.    Since users can define their own DESCRIBE methods and took their cue    from the system, describing some user structures also require such    interactions.  Cost to Implementors:    None.  Cost to Users:    User code which depended on DESCRIBE running without user interaction    would have to be modified. Such code is not currently fully portable,    however.  Cost of Non-Adoption:    Users would not know the straight story about whether they should    expect interaction from DESCRIBE.  Benefits:    Implementations which don't do interactive querying in DESCRIBE only    because their not 100% sure it's kosher would be free to do it.  Aesthetics:    Some people might think it's not aesthetic for DESCRIBE to require user    intervention. Not saying whether it's permissible is probably less    aesthetic, though.Proposal (DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:NO):    Specify that DESCRIBE is forbidden to prompt for or require    user input.  Permit implementations to extend describe via keyword    arguments to prompt for or require user input as long as the default    action if no keyword arguments are supplied does not prompt for or    require user input.    This is an incompatible change for some implementations.  Test Case:    The following kind of interaction would be permissible in    implementations which chose to do it:     (DEFVAR *MY-TABLE* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE))     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOO *MY-TABLE*) 1)     (SETF (GETHASH 'BAR *MY-TABLE*) 2)     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOOBAR *MY-TABLE*) 3)     (DESCRIBE *MY-TABLE* :INTERACTIVE T)     #<EQ-HASH-TABLE 259> has 3 entries.     Do you want to see its contents? (Yes or No) Yes  Rationale:    DESCRIBE is the only hook a portable program has for providing    information about objects to the user.  The potential interactive    functions of DESCRIBE are also likely to be available via INSPECT.  Current Practice:    Symbolics Genera asks some questions interactively when describing    some kinds of structured data structures, such as hash tables.    Since users can define their own DESCRIBE methods and took their cue    from the system, describing some user structures also require such    interactions.  Cost to Implementors:    Symbolics Genera and other non-conforming implementations will have    to change.  Cost to Users:    User code which depends on DESCRIBE running with user interaction    will have to be modified. Such code is not currently portable,    however.  Cost of Non-Adoption:    Users would not have any portable way to have progams inform the    user about object they are dealing with.  This might be important in    traces and logs of portable progams or in portable debugging tools.  Benefits:    It will be easier to provide some types of portable functionality.  Aesthetics:    This simplifies the language slightly.Discussion:  Pitman thinks it's important to clarify this issue, but he isn't fussy  about the particulars.  EXPLICITY-VAGUE proposal is the minimal proposal for compatibility  with current behavior.  Some members of the cleanup committee think that EXPLICITLY-VAGUE is  really a change from the intent of CLtL. However, the current  sentiment is to be less rather than more specific about the behavior  of debugging tools (25.3 of CLtL).  It might be possible to extend DESCRIBE to have additional   keywords (:VERBOSE, :INTERACTIVE-ALLOWED) to cover   additional behavior.   Pierson supports NO because he thinks it's important for there to be  some way for portable programs to present this sort of information  to the user.  While the exact data and format presented is  implementation dependent and thus outside of the bounds of  standardization, the existance of such data is neither.  Moon opposes NO because "it creates extra work for implementors and  users of at least one implementation, for no compelling reason."  Moon suggested as a compromise only allowing DESCRIBE to require  user input from "interactive streams".  Several other members of the  committee like this in principle but question whether it's feasible  since we have neither defined "interactive streams" nor provided any  portable way to tell if a stream is interactive.*start*02035 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 16 NOV 88 10:41:06 PSTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 16 Nov 88  10:38:28 PSTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 493533; Wed 16-Nov-88 13:36:50 ESTDate: Wed, 16 Nov 88 13:33 ESTFrom: David A.

Pierson <pierson@mist.ARPA>    You yourself proposed INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P in issue    STREAM-CAPABILITIES on July 5.  I'm not sure why this issue has    gotten nowhere, but I suspect it is because two essentially    unrelated proposals got mixed together; one is    INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P, the other is the attempt to standardize a    way to tell whether two streams connect to the same ultimate    source or sink of data.  I don't think it's at all problematical    to define INTERACTIVE-STREAM-P in a practically precise enough    way.    True, I haven't been pursuing the issue because it seemed to generatea lot of opposition and little support.  I'll look through my archivesand see if I can come up with a new version.I don't oppose your compromise in princple, I'm just reluctant to makeDESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE depend on STREAM-CAPABILITIES' passage.  Ofcourse, this probably matters more to me than you since I want tochange the status quo and you don't.*start*07048 00024 US Date:  7 Dec 88 15:52 PSTSender: masinter.paTo: X3J13@Sail.stanford.educc: MasinterFrom: CL-cleanup@Sail.Stanford.eduSubject: Issue: DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE (Version 4)reply-to: CL-CLEANUP@Sail.stanford.eduline-fold: NOThis issue has two proposals, EXPLICITLY-VAGUE and NO.Notes from Fairfax meeting..."...thinks it's stupid to waste time on issues like this....others disagreed."Issue:        DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVEReferences:   DESCRIBE (p441)Category:     CLARIFICATION (EXPLICITLY-VAGUE) / CHANGE (NO)Edit history: 12-Sep-88, Version 1 by Pitman              23-Sep-88, Version 2 by Masinter              19-Oct-88, Version 3 by Pierson, invert              15-Nov-88, Version 4 by Pierson, two-proposal versionProblem Description:  CLtL is not clear about whether DESCRIBE may be interactive.  While CLtL describes INSPECT as an interactive as an  interactive version of DESCRIBE, it doesn't make explicit  that DESCRIBE is non-interactive. In some implementations it is,   and in other implementations it is not.  Users of systems in which DESCRIBE is not interactive may presume  that it is safe to call DESCRIBE in a batch applications without  hanging the application, which can lead to problems.Proposal (DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:EXPLICITLY-VAGUE):    Specify that DESCRIBE is permitted (though not required) to    require user input, and that such input should be negotiated    through *QUERY-IO*.    Descriptive information would continue to go to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*.  Test Case:    The following kind of interaction would be permissible in    implementations which chose to do it:     (DEFVAR *MY-TABLE* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE))     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOO *MY-TABLE*) 1)     (SETF (GETHASH 'BAR *MY-TABLE*) 2)     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOOBAR *MY-TABLE*) 3)     (DESCRIBE *MY-TABLE*)     #<EQ-HASH-TABLE 259> has 3 entries.     Do you want to see its contents? (Yes or No) Yes  Rationale:    This validates current implementations.  Current Practice:    Symbolics Genera asks some questions interactively when describing    some kinds of structured data structures, such as hash tables.    Since users can define their own DESCRIBE methods and took their cue    from the system, describing some user structures also require such    interactions.  Cost to Implementors:    None.  Cost to Users:    User code which depended on DESCRIBE running without user interaction    would have to be modified. Such code is not currently fully portable,    however.  Cost of Non-Adoption:    Users would not know the straight story about whether they should    expect interaction from DESCRIBE.  Benefits:    Implementations which don't do interactive querying in DESCRIBE only    because their not 100% sure it's kosher would be free to do it.  Aesthetics:    Some people might think it's not aesthetic for DESCRIBE to require user    intervention. Not saying whether it's permissible is probably less    aesthetic, though.Proposal (DESCRIBE-INTERACTIVE:NO):    Specify that DESCRIBE is forbidden to prompt for or require    user input.  Permit implementations to extend describe via keyword    arguments to prompt for or require user input as long as the default    action if no keyword arguments are supplied does not prompt for or    require user input.    This is an incompatible change for some implementations.  Test Case:    The following kind of interaction would be permissible in    implementations which chose to do it:     (DEFVAR *MY-TABLE* (MAKE-HASH-TABLE))     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOO *MY-TABLE*) 1)     (SETF (GETHASH 'BAR *MY-TABLE*) 2)     (SETF (GETHASH 'FOOBAR *MY-TABLE*) 3)     (DESCRIBE *MY-TABLE* :INTERACTIVE T)     #<EQ-HASH-TABLE 259> has 3 entries.     Do you want to see its contents? (Yes or No) Yes  Rationale:    DESCRIBE is the only hook a portable program has for providing    information about objects to the user.  The potential interactive    functions of DESCRIBE are also likely to be available via INSPECT.  Current Practice:    Symbolics Genera asks some questions interactively when describing    some kinds of structured data structures, such as hash tables.    Since users can define their own DESCRIBE methods and took their cue    from the system, describing some user structures also require such    interactions.  Cost to Implementors:    Symbolics Genera and other non-conforming implementations will have    to change.  Cost to Users:    User code which depends on DESCRIBE running with user interaction    will have to be modified. Such code is not currently portable,    however.  Cost of Non-Adoption:    Users would not have any portable way to have progams inform the    user about object they are dealing with.  This might be important in    traces and logs of portable progams or in portable debugging tools.  Benefits:    It will be easier to provide some types of portable functionality.  Aesthetics:    This simplifies the language slightly.Discussion:  Pitman thinks it's important to clarify this issue, but he isn't fussy  about the particulars.  EXPLICITY-VAGUE proposal is the minimal proposal for compatibility  with current behavior.  Some members of the cleanup committee think that EXPLICITLY-VAGUE is  really a change from the intent of CLtL. However, the current  sentiment is to be less rather than more specific about the behavior  of debugging tools (25.3 of CLtL).  It might be possible to extend DESCRIBE to have additional   keywords (:VERBOSE, :INTERACTIVE-ALLOWED) to cover   additional behavior.   Pierson supports NO because he thinks it's important for there to be  some way for portable programs to present this sort of information  to the user.  While the exact data and format presented is  implementation dependent and thus outside of the bounds of  standardization, the existance of such data is neither.  Moon opposes NO because "it creates extra work for implementors and  users of at least one implementation, for no compelling reason."  Moon suggested as a compromise only allowing DESCRIBE to require  user input from "interactive streams".  Several other members of the  committee like this in principle but question whether it's feasible  since we have neither defined "interactive streams" nor provided any  portable way to tell if a stream is interactive.        

It can be extended by users using DEFSTRUCT,  but not DEFTYPE nor DEFCLASS, but it cannot be extended by implementations.  Whether certain types such as NUMBER and ARRAY are subtypes of COMMON  is implementation-dependent.  The goal of having the COMMON type was  probably to improve portability, but it is unclear how it could actually  be used in that way.Proposal (COMMON-TYPE:REMOVE):  Remove COMMON and COMMONP from the language.Rationale:    Keeping the definition of COMMON accurate in the new specification, in  the face of changes elsewhere in the language such as the introduction  of CLOS and the possible introduction of character registries, is  difficult when no one is sure what COMMON is for.  If no one uses COMMON,  it would be less work to just get rid of it.Current practice:    Every implementation probably implements COMMON.  Moon has never seen it  used except in a program to test whether its implementation matched CLtL.Cost to Implementors:  None.Cost to Users:  None unless they are actually using COMMON.Cost of non-adoption:    Implementors would have to maintain COMMON.  Users would have to try to  understand it, or figure out that they didn't care about it.Performance impact:  None.Benefits:  Simpler language.Esthetics:  Simpler language.Discussion:  None.*start*01006 00024 US GV-Info: CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU at 20-Mar-89 14:44:57 from AGReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 20 MAR 89 14:44:59 PSTReceived: from Think.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 20 Mar 89  14:36:39 PSTReceived: from fafnir.think.com by Think.COM; Mon, 20 Mar 89 17:27:04 ESTReturn-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from verdi.think.com by fafnir.think.com; Mon, 20 Mar 89 17:28:00 ESTReceived: by verdi.think.com; Mon, 20 Mar 89 17:24:46 ESTDate: Mon, 20 Mar 89 17:24:46 ESTFrom: Guy Steele <gls@Think.COM>Message-Id: <8903202224.AA19319@verdi.think.com>To: Moon@stony-brook.scrc.symbolics.comCc: CL-Cleanup@sail.stanford.edu, chapman%aitg.DEC@decwrl.dec.comIn-Reply-To: David A.

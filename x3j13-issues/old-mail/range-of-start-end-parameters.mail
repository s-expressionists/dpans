If the argument is optional or key (as is the case for all  functions referenced above except SUBSEQ), the value will default to  0 if not supplied. It is not permissible to pass NIL as this argument.  Clarify that for functions permitting a parameter named END, END1,  or END2 which delimits the end point in a sequence to be considered  for some operation, that paremeter must be a non-negative integer  indicating a termination point or NIL indicating the last element  in the sequence. If the argument is optional or key (as is the case  for all functions referenced above), the value will default to NIL  if not supplied. Supplying NIL is, therefore, equivalent to not  supplying this argument.Test Case:  (SEARCH "F" "FOO" :START1 NIL) is an error.  (SEARCH "F" "FOO" :START2 0) is permissible and is equivalent to  (SEARCH "F" "FOO")  (SEARCH "F" "FOO" :END2 NIL) is permissible and is equivalent to  (SEARCH "F" "FOO")Rationale:  To keep data flow between programs from becoming excessively complicated,  it's a good idea to specify what the default values are so that they can  be passed explicitly rather than requiring an alternate calling sequence  for all possible cases where the value might need to default.Current Practice:  Symbolics Genera implements the proposed behavior.Cost to Implementors:  Hopefully most implementations already do this. Those that do not will  probably have to make quite a number of small changes to both the code  for these functions and to any associated compiler optimizers.Cost to Users:  This change is upward compatible with existing user code. Any program  which did not conform to this proposal was already not portable.Cost of Non-Adoption:  Subtle gratuitous differences in the handling of these arguments would  continue to be a possibility and a barrier to portability.Benefits:  The language would be more regular and well-defined.Aesthetics:  If it makes things clearer, it's an improvement.Discussion:  Pitman supports RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS:INTEGER-AND-INTEGER-NIL.*start*01051 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([10.0.0.11]) by Xerox.COM ; 14 SEP 88 11:32:48 PDTReceived: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM (SCRC-STONY-BROOK.ARPA) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 14 Sep 88  11:30:31 PDTReceived: from EUPHRATES.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 459118; Wed 14-Sep-88 14:29:18 EDTDate: Wed, 14 Sep 88 14:28 EDTFrom: David A.

It would be    subsumed by RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS if the latter also    stated that the END be greater than or equal to START and no greater    than the LENGTH of the sequence.Yeah, I'd thought about this...Turns out that SUBSEQ-OUT-OF-BOUNDS is already voted on (and accepted)so I think it's best not to bring it up now or we might just confusethings.Also, the treatment of bounds information is really a completelydifferent thing than the treatment of argument type. The RANGE-...issue has to do with things that are largely statically detectable (or at least, independently detectable). The bounds issue has todo with interdependencies of arguments.Further, the treatment of bounds errors is more likely to vary byfunction. I'd have to study things much more carefully to decide forsure that it wasn't ok for some bounds issues to be ignored by somefunctions.So in spite of the overlap, I think the best way to proceed is justto address this issue on its own merits and let Kathy worry aboutthe ultimate presentation.*start*04117 00024 USfDate:  7 Oct 88 20:55 PDTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Issue: RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS (Version 1)To: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduREPLY-TO: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduline-fold: NOcc: MasinterIssue:        RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERSReferences:   COUNT (p257), COUNT-IF (p257), COUNT-IF-NOT (p257),	      DELETE (p257), DELETE-DUPLICATES (p254), DELETE-IF (p254),	      DELETE-IF-NOT (p254), FILL (p252), FIND (p257), FIND-IF (p257),	      FIND-IF-NOT (p257), MAKE-STRING-INPUT-STREAM (p330),	      MISMATCH (p257), NSTRING-CAPITALIZE (p304), 	      NSTRING-DOWNCASE (p304), NSTRING-UPCASE (p304), SUBSTITUTE (p255),	      NSUBSTITUTE-IF (p256), NSUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT (p256), 	      PARSE-INTEGER (p381), PARSE-NAMESTRING (p414), POSITION (p257),	      POSITION-IF (p257), POSITION-IF-NOT (p257), 	      READ-FROM-STRING (p381), REDUCE (p251), REMOVE (p253), 	      REMOVE-DUPLICATES (p254), REMOVE-IF (p253), REMOVE-IF-NOT (p253),	      REPLACE (p252), SEARCH (p258), STRING-CAPITALIZE (p303),	      STRING-EQUAL (p301), STRING-DOWNCASE (p303), STRING-GREATERP (p302),	      STRING-LESSP (p302), STRING-NOT-EQUAL (p302),	      STRING-NOT-GREATERP (p302), STRING-NOT-LESSP (p302),	      STRING-UPCASE (p303), STRING/= (p301), STRING< (p301), 	      STRING<= (p301), STRING= (p300), STRING> (p301), STRING>= (p301),	      SUBSEQ (p248), SUBSTITUTE (p255), SUBSTITUTE-IF (p255), 	      SUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT (p255), WRITE-LINE (p384), WRITE-STRING (p384)Category:     CLARIFICATIONEdit history: 14-Sep-88, Version 1 by PitmanProblem Description:  CLtL is not always clear about the possible values which the START and END  parameters of built-in Common Lisp can take.Proposal (RANGE-OF-START-AND-END-PARAMETERS:INTEGER-AND-INTEGER-NIL):  Clarify that for functions permitting a parameter named START, START1,  or START2 which delimits the beginning point in a sequence to be  considered for some operation, that paremeter must be a non-negative  integer.

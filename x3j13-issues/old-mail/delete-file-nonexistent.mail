I just recently acquired electronic copy.It happens that I don't think the writeup is clear and I don'tagree with the proposal, but I wanted to first get it into thearchives before discussing it. -kmp-----Issue:        DELETE-NONEXISTENT-FILEReferences:   DELETE-FILE (p. 424)Category:     CHANGEEdit history: 5-OCT-88, Version 1 by ChapmanProblem Description:An implementation determines whether an attempt to delete a nonexistentfile is considerd to be successful.Proposal (DELETE-NONEXISTENT-FILE:RETURN-VALUE)DELETE-FILE can currently return a non-nil value in the case ofsuccess, or signal an error in the case of failure. The proposed changeis that DELETE-FILE return a non-nil value when the file exists andis successfully deleted, nil when the file doesn't exist, and signalsan error otherwise.Rationale:This change allows users to portably depend on a return value whenDELETE-FILE is executed on a nonexistent file.Current Practice:Adoption Cost:Minimal.Benefits:This change will assist users in writing portable code.Conversion Cost:Minimal.Aesthetics:None.Discussion:*start*00955 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 02 JAN 89 22:36:43 PSTReceived: from Xerox.COM by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 2 Jan 89  22:36:43 PSTReceived: from Semillon.ms by ArpaGateway.ms ; 02 JAN 89 22:32:31 PSTDate: 2 Jan 89 22:31 PSTFrom: masinter.paSubject: Re: Issue: DELETE-FILE-NONEXISTENT (Version 1)In-reply-to: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>'s message of Sun, 13 Nov 88 18:32 ESTTo: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>cc: CL-Cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.EDUMessage-ID: <890102-223231-1974@Xerox>I renamed this from DELETE-NONEXISTENT-FILE.I agree that I don't like the proposal. I'd like DELETE-FILE to spell outwhat the classes of errors it would get when the file didn't exist vs whenthe file couldn't be deleted.Did you have those on your list of error signals?

They're the same. :-}Sorry. I guess I didn't read carefully enough.But I'm pretty sure I knew what threw me off, and it might be worthcorrecting the style. In the problem description, you enumerate thecases without the use of [...]. Then later you introduce the brackets,so I was looking for  var | (var) | (var val)when you'd written var | (var [val])etc. You might want to consider one of the following syntactic tricksto help keep others from falling into the same trap: * Use notation such as the following in the problem description:    do   & do*:            (var [init [step]])    prog & prog*:    var | (var [init])    let  & let*:     var | (var val)   so that it matches the proposal. * Use notation such as the following in the proposal:    do   & do*:      var | (var) | (var init) | (var init step)    prog & prog*:    var | (var) | (var init)    let  & let*:     var | (var) | (var init)   in the proposal so it matches the problem description.   * Say something in the running text of the proposal to make it clear   what's going on to people like me who don't read carefully enough.   eg,       ``Extend the language to permit all of the following syntaxes:''Also, the category for this change is wrong. It should be listed as an ADDITION,not a CHANGE since it is not incompatible.And while you're in there, I'd extend the rationale section to add thecomments I made in my last message. There are, after all, other ways youcould have gone with this proposal (such as the way I thought you wereproposing).  When the rationale section can put concern about suchalternatives to rest, I think it should.You can add my support of the proposal to the discussion section.*start*02085 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([10.0.0.11]) by Xerox.COM ; 26 JUL 88 16:59:35 PDTReceived: from hub (ucsbcsl.ucsb.edu) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 26 Jul 88  16:58:36 PDTReceived: from csilvax.ucsb.edu by hub (5.59) id AA08804; Tue, 26 Jul 88 16:58:34 PDTReceived: from  by csilvax.ucsb.CSNET (5.51) id AA00859; Tue, 26 Jul 88 16:52:33 PDTDate: Tue, 26 Jul 88 16:52:33 PDTFrom: Skona Brittain <skona%csilvax@hub.ucsb.edu>Posted-Date: Tue, 26 Jul 88 16:52:33 PDTTo: cl-cleanup@SAIL.Stanford.eduSubject: ISSUE: VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRYCc: skona@csilvax.ucsbIssue:          VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRYReferences:     CLtL pgs. 110, 122, 131Category:       CHANGEEdit history:   Revision 1 by Skona Brittain 07/26/88Problem Description:The symtax of items in the variable-list for various control structues(do, let, prog and their duals) varies.

This stupid little inconsistencyhas been irritating me and others for a while now.However, I recommend re-casting the proposal to permit all three forms.The rationale for that is: - Most implementations provide all three versions since Maclisp   did. In cases where there is a pre-CL tradition, that's usually   the winner. - Regularization is nice, but some may find it gratuitous. To    minimize code breakage, the right thing is to only add cases,   not remove any, if that is feasible. In this case, it is    trivially possible. Simply add ``(VAR)'' for DO and DO*   and ``VAR'' for LET/LET*.Btw, in Current Practice, Symbolics Genera permits all three forms.*start*03156 00024 USfReturn-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([10.0.0.11]) by Xerox.COM ; 04 AUG 88 15:23:08 PDTReceived: from hub (HUB.UCSB.EDU) by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 4 Aug 88  15:22:38 PDTReceived: from csilvax.ucsb.edu by hub (5.59) id AA02242; Thu, 4 Aug 88 15:22:22 PDTReceived: from  by csilvax.ucsb.CSNET (5.51) id AA24449; Thu, 4 Aug 88 15:15:33 PDTDate: Thu, 4 Aug 88 15:15:33 PDTFrom: Skona Brittain <skona%csilvax@hub.ucsb.edu>Posted-Date: Thu, 4 Aug 88 15:15:33 PDTTo: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduSubject: ISSUE: VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRYIssue:          VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRYReferences:     CLtL pgs. 110, 122, 131Category:       ADDITIONEdit history:   Revision 1 by Skona Brittain 07/26/88                Revision 2 by Skona Brittain 08/04/88 (change of category,                                                       spelling & verbosity)Problem Description:The syntax of items in the variable-list for various control structues(do, let, prog and their duals) varies.

This variation seems unnecessary.  The allowed variations are indicated in the following chart:  do & do*:             (var)    (var init)    (var init step) prog & prog*:   var   (var)    (var init)       n.a. let & let*:     var            (var val)        n.a. compiler-let    var            (var value)  Note that just plain `` var '' is prohibited in do forms and that the case of ``(var)'' is prohibited in let forms and compiler-let forms.Proposal (VARIABLE-LIST-ASYMMETRY:SYMMETRIZE): Allow all the variations in all of the forms; i.e. add the prohibited cases mentioned above.  I.e. change the variable-list in the syntax descriptions as follows:  do & do*:     ( { var | (var [init [step]] ) }* )  let & let*:   ( { var | (var [value]       ) }* )  compiler-let: ( { var | (var [value]       ) }* )Test Cases: (let          (a (b) (c 3)) ... )  would be valid. (let*         (a (b) (c 3)) ... )  would be valid. (do           (a (b) (c 3)) ... )  would be valid. (do*          (a (b) (c 3)) ... )  would be valid. (compiler-let (a (b) (c 3)) ... )  would be valid.Rationale: The asymmetry is unnecessary and impedes learning of CL.  Any other way to make these cases consistent, such as either omitting just ``var'' from do & do* and prog & prog*, or omitting ``(var)'' from let & let* and prog & prog*,  would be an incompatible change to the language.   This way just adds the flexibility found in some of the forms to all of them.Current Practice: KCL allows ``(var)'' in let & let* but not ``var'' in do & do*.  Symbolics Genera allows all three cases in all the forms; i.e. it conforms to this proposal.Cost to Implementors: Extremely slight. (May involve subtracting code rather than adding it).Cost to Users: None.Cost of Non-Adoption: The variation in syntax makes them harder to learn.Benefits: Ease of learning.Aesthetics: Symmetry is more aesthetic than asymmetry, at least to some of us.Discussion:  Pitman supports this proposal. The issue about whether the atomic ``var'' should be allowed at all in the  variable lists for let & let* is a separate issue.  (So is whether it should mean that the var is initially bound to nil.)  Since it is allowed,  this proposal merely says that the alternative syntax of an atom within a  list with no initial value, ``(var)'', should also be allowed.        TITAN 

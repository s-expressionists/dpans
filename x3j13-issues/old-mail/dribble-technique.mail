Issue:        DRIBBLE-TECHNIQUE
References:   DRIBBLE (p443)
Category:     CLARIFICATION
Edit history: 06-Dec-87, Version 1 by Pitman
Status:	      For Internal Discussion

Problem Description:

  The intent and effect of DRIBBLE is not very clearly specified.

Proposal (DRIBBLE-TECHNIQUE:MAKE-EXPLICITLY-VAGUE):

  Clarify that DRIBBLE is intended primarily for interactive debugging
  and that its effect cannot be relied upon from programs.

Test Case:

 #1: (PROGN (DRIBBLE "temp")
	    (PRINT 'FOO)
            (DRIBBLE))

 #2: (DRIBBLE "temp")
     (PROGN (PRINT 'FOO)
            (DRIBBLE)
	    (PRINC 'BAR))	 

Rationale:

  Users of DRIBBLE have been surprised about how differently DRIBBLE
  behaves in different implementations. This makes the status quo
  much more explicit and will lead to less surprise.

Current Practice:

  Some implementations implement DRIBBLE as a function which simply
  assigns streams such as *STANDARD-OUTPUT* to broadcast streams
  (or the approximate equivalent thereof).  Even within this camp,
  there is not widespread agreement about which streams are affected.
  However, typically test case #1 will capture the output of (PRINT 'FOO)
  in the file "temp" and will execute (PRINT 'BAR) but not capture its
  output.

  Some implementations (eg, Symbolics) push to a recursive command
  loop when DRIBBLE is called with an argument, and return from that
  command loop when DRIBBLE is called with no argument. In these
  implementations, test case #1 will enter a recursive command loop
  upon the first call to DRIBBLE and will not execute the (PRINT 'FOO)
  until (DRIBBLE) is done interactively. When the second (DRIBBLE)
  in test case #1 is executed, DRIBBLE will complain that output is
  not currently being recorded. In test case #2, the output of 
  (PRINT 'FOO) will be captured, but the form (PRINT 'BAR) will never
  be executed because (DRIBBLE) does not return normally (it throws).

Adoption Cost:

  None. This is just a clarification.

Benefits:

  Users will be aware that they cannot rely on DRIBBLE in portable code.

Conversion Cost:

  Effectively none.  Anyone who currently uses DRIBBLE in code that is
  believed to be portable is kidding himself. If such code works in some
  implementations, it can continue to work.

Aesthetics:

  Since this is a clarification, there is no significant change to
  the aesthetics.

Discussion:

  Pitman wrote this proposal as a straw man so that CL-Cleanup would have
  the issue on the books for explicit discussion.

I am wondering about the compatibility of Symbolics's implementation of
DRIBBLE with CLtL.  According to the Symbolics documentation (page 680
of Volume 2A of the Encyclopedia Symbolicorum), they believe that they
are compatible.

The way the Symbolics (DRIBBLE pathname) works is that it binds
*STANDRD-INPUT, *STANDARD-OUTPUT*, etc. to the dribble stream and then
calls the Lisp read-eval-print loop.  It also sets up a catch-tag.
(DRIBBLE) throws to the tag, and appropriate unwind-protects close the
dribble stream.

What does this mean as far as compatibility is concerned?  Consider the
following form:

(progn (dribble "filename")
       (print 'foo)
       (dribble))

From reading CLtL one would assume that this would print put FOO into
the file.  On a Symbolics system the first DRIBBLE starts recording I/O
and then goes to a new r-e-p loop; the PRINT doesn't get executed until
the user does (dribble), and then the second DRIBBLE complains that
output isn't being recorded.

Or how about typing:

(dribble "filename)
(progn (print 'foo)
       (dribble)
       (print 'bar))

The second PRINT will never get executed, because the (dribble) throws
out of the PROGN.

Finally, you could really get screwed if you start dribbling, do
something that gets you into the debugger, and decide to stop dribbling;
you will lose your debugger session.  This doesn't actually happen
because Symbolics disables dribbling when you go into the debugger or
when you get a new r-e-p loop with the Suspend key, so (dribble) just
says that output isn't being recorded and does nothing else.  (The fact
that debugger and break loop I/O isn't dribbled is another point of
contention I have.)

CLtL doesn't say a whole lot about DRIBBLE.  In particular, it doesn't
say what the return value is, but that doesn't mean that it is allowed
for (dribble) not to return, does it?  What do other Common Lispers
think?

I support DRIBBLE-TECHNIQUE:MAKE-EXPLICITLY-VAGUE.

I'm not sure exactly what KMP means by stating that this proposal is a
straw man, but I like it.  I think that it was a mistake to put dribble
into the manual, and that we should just tell users that it differs from
system to system.  I don't think that there's any hope of getting a
standard that makes sense on editor-top-level systems, dumb
Read-Eval-Print systems, and all the flavors in between, so we should
just punt on this.

The only advantage of mentioning DRIBBLE in the standard at all is that
users know what name to look up in any given system to get this general
sort of functionality.

Problem Description:

The intent and effect of DRIBBLE is not very clearly specified. Users have complained that DRIBBLE behaves quite differently in different implementations.

Proposal (DRIBBLE-TECHNIQUE:MAKE-EXPLICITLY-VAGUE):

Clarify that DRIBBLE is intended primarily for interactive debugging and that its effect cannot be relied upon from programs.

Test Case:

 #1: (PROGN (DRIBBLE "temp")
	    (PRINT 'FOO)
            (DRIBBLE))

 #2: (DRIBBLE "temp")
     (PROGN (PRINT 'FOO)
            (DRIBBLE)
	    (PRINC 'BAR))

None. This is just a clarification.

Benefits:

Users will be aware that they cannot rely on DRIBBLE in portable code.

Aesthetics:

No apparent effect.

Discussion:

DRIBBLE, like other environment features, is a standard interface to a non-standard feature. As such, there is some question as to its place in the ANSI standard. However, if DRIBBLE remains in the standard, its behavior is made explicitly vague by this proposal.

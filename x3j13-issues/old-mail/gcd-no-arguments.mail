I see there is a cleanup issue forLCM, and, if he is right, we should also chage GCD.  So I asked for amessage stating his views on GCD.  Here it is:---- Start of forwarded text ----Date: Tue, 10 Jan 89 20:52:26 GMTFrom: Richard Tobin <R.Tobin@uk.ac.ed>To: jeff@ed.aiaiSubject: GCD in CLtLCLtL defines (gcd) as zero, which seems bogus to me.  It should beundefined, as should (gcd 0).  The reasoning goes like this:Let f be a function that takes an arbitrary number of arguments.  Ifthere is an "identity" i, such that (f -some-args- i) is always thesame as (f -some-args-), then the value of (f) should be the same as(f i), if that is defined.  So far, so good.But 0 is certainly not the greatest common divisor of 0.  All integersdivide 0.  Furthermore, (gcd -some-args- -another-arg-) should never begreater than (gcd -some-args-), since it adds a constraint to the set ofnumbers of which we are computing the greatest.  But if (gcd 0) is 0,(gcd 4 0) (ie 4) is greater then (gcd 0).The only reasonable value for (gcd 0) would be some representation ofinfinity, but we don't have one, so it should be undefined.-- Richard---- End of forwarded text ----*start*01365 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 11 JAN 89 19:59:31 PSTReceived: from lucid.com by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 11 Jan 89  19:57:48 PSTReceived: from bhopal ([192.9.200.13]) by heavens-gate.lucid.com id AA04451g; Wed, 11 Jan 89 19:53:31 PSTReceived: by bhopal id AA07394g; Wed, 11 Jan 89 19:55:47 PSTDate: Wed, 11 Jan 89 19:55:47 PSTFrom: Jon L White <jonl@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8901120355.AA07394@bhopal>To: jeff%aiai.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSS.Cs.Ucl.AC.UKCc: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.edu, gls@think.com, richard%aiai.edinburgh.ac.uk@NSS.Cs.Ucl.AC.UKIn-Reply-To: Jeff Dalton's message of Tue, 10 Jan 89 23:37:00 GMT <15927.8901102337@subnode.aiai.ed.ac.uk>Subject: Possible issue: GCD-NO-ARGUMENTSThe LCM issue even appeared on Guy's "Clarifications" of 6-Dec-85".Tobin's reasoning about GCD looks ok to me, but it might not be thatbad simply to say that 0 is a singluar point for GCD.Not too long ago, I proposed adding rational infinities to CL (to thegeneral common-lisp mailing list, I think, rather than to Cl-cleanup);by analogy to IEEE floating infinities, we could have -1/0 and 1/0 asrational infinities.  There are a number of other reasons for wantingthese objects besides (GCD 0).-- JonL --

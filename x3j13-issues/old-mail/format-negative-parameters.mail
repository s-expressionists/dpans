I don't think that all of these    are explicitly flagged.  This should probably be fixed up in the    standard, but until then it seems reasonable to assume non-negative    integers unless there's some obvious meaning for the negative case.This would be a reasonable topic for us to address in CL-Cleanup.I agree that a reasonable approach for the interim, and in fact in thenext edition of the manual, is to say that format parameters are assumedto be non-negative integers except as specifically stated. Of course, we'llneed to specify clearly whether signalling an error or assuming 0 or whateveris the right thing otherwise, and that should perhaps be done by someone whohas surveyed all the ops to determine the likely impact on typical code ofassuming 0, etc.Cases where some implementations signal an error and others quietly ignorethe error are what drive developers of portable code nuts.By the way, I note that this case is most important where the user haswritten ~V%, since it's not statically detectable in that case that a problemhas arisen. Obviously, someone should write this up as a formal proposal. I've pickedthe issue name FORMAT-NEGATIVE-PARAMETERS above and this message can be usedto seed the proposal when someone has time to write it.*start*00793 00024 US Return-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from Think.COM by Xerox.COM ; 02 DEC 87 14:43:42 PSTReturn-Path: <gls@Think.COM>Received: from kali.think.com by Think.COM; Wed, 2 Dec 87 17:28:56 ESTReceived: by kali.think.com; Wed, 2 Dec 87 17:28:52 ESTDate: Wed, 2 Dec 87 17:28:52 ESTFrom: gls@Think.COMMessage-Id: <8712022228.AA04848@kali.think.com>To: Masinter.paCc: Steele@Think.COMIn-Reply-To: Masinter.pa@xerox.com's message of 23 Nov 87 14:25 PST <871123-142526-2785@Xerox>Subject: [Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>: FORMAT-NEGATIVE-PARAMETERS]   Date: 23 Nov 87 14:25 PST   From: Masinter.pa@xerox.com   Did you volunteer to write up the format issues? I thought Ellen Waldrum of TI had this one, but I'll do it if she doesn't.--Guy

Nevertheless, the need for this restriction isunaesthetic, and that consideration changed my opposition to thisproposal from vehement to mild.

FLUSH-ALL)		05-Oct-88, Version 2 by Pitman (add option FLUSH-TEST-NOT)Status:         For Internal DiscussionProblem Description:  The -IF-NOT functions are functionally unnecessary.  The :TEST-NOT keywords are not only functionally unnecessary but  also problematic because it's not clear what to do when both :TEST  and :TEST-NOT are provided.  Many people think Common Lisp is more `bloated' than it needs  to be and these aspects of the language are commonly cited  specific examples.Proposal (TEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-ALL):  Remove all -IF-NOT functions (named above) from Common Lisp.  Remove the :TEST-NOT keyword from the Common Lisp functions which   currently provide them (named above).  Rationale:      This makes the language a bit simpler.      The removal of :TEST-NOT also makes the language easier to explain.    Cost to Implementors:      Very slight.      Some symbols would disappear from the LISP package but could    still be offered in proprietary packages if deemed important    enough.      Implementations could compatibly retain the :TEST-NOT keywords    for an interim period.  Proposal (TEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-TEST-NOT):  Remove the :TEST-NOT keyword from the Common Lisp functions which   currently provide them (named above).  Rationale:      This makes the language a bit simpler and easier to explain.    Cost to Implementors:      Very slight.      Implementations could compatibly retain the :TEST-NOT keywords    for an interim period.  Current Practice:  Presumably no one has done this yet.Cost to Users:  Some rewrites would be needed.  Those rewrites, which are already fairly simple, would be even  more simple if some form of the FUNCTION-COMPOSITION issue is  voted in -- in particular, the COMPLEMENT function which it   proposes would help enormously in this regard.Cost of Non-Adoption:  Common Lisp would continue to be what some people feel is  "bigger than it needs to be".Benefits:  The cost of non-adoption would be avoided.Aesthetics:  Presumably this makes the language easier to teach.Discussion:  Moon expressed reservations about FLUSH-ALL (in Version 1, where  FLUSH-TEST-NOT was not offered) because it was such an incompatible  change.  Steele (commenting on Version 1) noted that his main reservation to  FLUSH-ALL is that he uses REMOVE-IF-NOT much more than REMOVE-IF.  Pierson, Dalton and Pitman support the combination of  TEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-ALL (and FUNCTION-COMPOSITION:NEW-FUNCTIONS)  in spite of the incompatible change because of the aesthetic appeal.  This issue is related to FUNCTION-COMPOSITION, but is not dependent  on it.  van Roggen points out that a long time ago, he suggested dropping  -IF-NOT and :TEST-NOT, adding a function such as COMPLEMENT, and  adding a #~ readmacro such that       (FIND-IF-NOT #'ZEROP '(0 0 3))   == (FIND-IF (COMPLEMENT #'ZEROP) '(0 0 3))   == (FIND-IF #~ZEROP '(0 0 3))  Richard Mlynarik suggests that even the -IF functions provide  little extra use since   (xxx-IF test sequence ...)  can be rewritten   (xxx test sequence :test #'funcall).  He says he doesn't care what we do with this issue, however, since  he will just continue to use [MIT-style] LOOP in cases where these  sequence functions would seem to be called for.     ----- End

I think that FLUSH-ALL wouldhave been a terrific idea 5 years ago but doing it now would cause toomany problems for existing code.

No slight to Kathy intended, butshe just plain cannot be permitted to make unilateral arbitrary decisionsabout what we might or might want to throw out of the language in somesubsequent standard. She must be able to justify any change from thestatus quo on the basis of some technical backup provided by this oranother committee. Without input from X3J13, she is chartered to dono more than modify the presentation. She cannot, of her own accord,change the semantics and she cannot make claims about changes that willhappen in the future (which is what deprecation is about) without riskingamazing grief when it comes time to review her document.Nothing prohibits us from making any proposal be to simply deprecatesomething (and eventually we'll have to define technically what thatwill mean). But it -does- require cleanup (or whatever committee) timeto prepare a vote for X3J13.*start*01311 00024 US Return-Path: <CL-Cleanup-mailer@SAIL.Stanford.EDU>Redistributed: xerox-cl-cleanup^.paReceived: from SAIL.Stanford.EDU ([36.86.0.194]) by Xerox.COM ; 18 OCT 88 21:47:28 PDTReceived: from lucid.com by SAIL.Stanford.EDU with TCP; 18 Oct 88  21:46:16 PDTReceived: from bhopal ([192.9.200.13]) by LUCID.COM id AA06569g; Tue, 18 Oct 88 21:46:10 PDTReceived: by bhopal id AA03592g; Tue, 18 Oct 88 21:44:37 PDTDate: Tue, 18 Oct 88 21:44:37 PDTFrom: Jon L White <jonl@lucid.com>Message-Id: <8810190444.AA03592@bhopal>To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.eduCc: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduIn-Reply-To: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.edu's message of 8 Oct 88 22:07 PDT <881008-220711-2583@Xerox>Subject: DRAFT Issue: TEST-NOT-IF-NOT (Version 2)Several others have already expressed my sentiments towards this proposal --that it would have been a nice idea five years ago, but is a gratuitousincompatibility now.

Although procedurally that sounds like morework, if there is any chance that this issue will fail for lackof having done so, I think it would be worth the work.*start*06118 00024 USfDate:  9 Dec 88 15:26 PSTSender: masinter.paTo: x3j13@sail.stanford.eduSubject: Issue: TEST-NOT-IF-NOT (Version 2)From: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.edureply-to: cl-cleanup@sail.stanford.educc: masinterline-fold: noThis issue has two proposals.Some people have indicated that they will vote forone of these only conditionally, e.g.,    "Yes, if you change "REMOVE" to "DEPRECATE" and define the   term "DEPRECATE" in a way that permits the retention of these   primitives for the near term with intent to phase them out   later."Forum: CleanupIssue:          TEST-NOT-IF-NOTReferences:     Functions offering a :TEST-NOT keyword:                 ADJOIN (p276), ASSOC (p280), COUNT (p257), DELETE (p254),                 DELETE-DUPLICATES (p254), FIND (p257),                 INTERSECTION (p277), MEMBER (p275), MISMATCH (p257),                 NINTERSECTION (p277), NSET-DIFFERENCE (p278),                 NSET-EXCLUSIVE-OR (p278), NSUBLIS (p275), NSUBST (p274),                 NSUBSTITUTE (p256), NUNION (p276), POSITION (p257),                 RASSOC (p281), REMOVE (p253), REMOVE-DUPLICATES (p254),                 SEARCH (p258), SET-DIFFERENCE (p278),                  SET-EXCLUSIVE-OR (p278), SUBLIS (p274), SUBSETP (p279),                 SUBST (p273), SUBSTITUTE (p255), TREE-EQUAL (p264),                 UNION (p276);                Functions with "-IF-NOT" in their name:                 ASSOC-IF-NOT (p280), COUNT-IF-NOT (p257),                 DELETE-IF-NOT (p254), FIND-IF-NOT (p257),                 MEMBER-IF-NOT (p275), NSUBST-IF-NOT (p274),                 NSUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT (p256), POSITION-IF-NOT (p257),                 RASSOC-IF-NOT (p281), REMOVE-IF-NOT (p253),                 SUBST-IF-NOT (p273), SUBSTITUTE-IF-NOT (p255);Related Issue:  FUNCTION-COMPOSITIONCategory:       CHANGEEdit history:   02-Oct-88, Version 1 by Pitman (just FLUSH-ALL)                05-Oct-88, Version 2 by Pitman (add option FLUSH-TEST-NOT)Problem Description:  The -IF-NOT functions are functionally unnecessary.  The :TEST-NOT keywords are not only functionally unnecessary but  also problematic because it's not clear what to do when both :TEST  and :TEST-NOT are provided.  Many people think Common Lisp is more `bloated' than it needs  to be and these aspects of the language are commonly cited  specific examples.Proposal (TEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-ALL):  Remove all -IF-NOT functions (named above) from Common Lisp.  Remove the :TEST-NOT keyword from the Common Lisp functions which   currently provide them (named above).  Rationale:      This makes the language a bit simpler.      The removal of :TEST-NOT also makes the language easier to explain.    Cost to Implementors:      Very slight.      Some symbols would disappear from the LISP package but could    still be offered in proprietary packages if deemed important    enough.      Implementations could compatibly retain the :TEST-NOT keywords    for an interim period.  Proposal (TEST-NOT-IF-NOT:FLUSH-TEST-NOT):  Remove the :TEST-NOT keyword from the Common Lisp functions which   currently provide them (named above).  Rationale:      This makes the language a bit simpler and easier to explain.    Cost to Implementors:      Very slight.      Implementations could compatibly retain the :TEST-NOT keywords    for an interim period.  Current Practice:  Presumably no one has done this yet.Cost to Users:  Some rewrites would be needed.  Those rewrites, which are already fairly simple, would be even  more simple if some form of the FUNCTION-COMPOSITION issue is  voted in -- in particular, the COMPLEMENT function which it   proposes would help enormously in this regard.Cost of Non-Adoption:  Common Lisp would continue to be what some people feel is  "bigger than it needs to be".Benefits:  The cost of non-adoption would be avoided.Aesthetics:  Presumably this makes the language easier to teach.Performance impact:  Very small; removing the :TEST-NOT keywords would  make the simple implementation of the functions that  used to have them slightly faster, but the resulting  code of the inner loop is likely to be much slower.Discussion:  Many people objected strongly to both of these proposals --  they might have been a nice idea five years ago, but are  gratuitous incompatibilities now: incompatible changes with  insufficient payback.  Some of those objections might be tempered if some additional  changes were made to Common Lisp: adding a COMPLEMENT  function, or if there were a strategy to declare some parts of the  language "obsolete".

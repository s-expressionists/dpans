He asked ``Can I make the time zone be most-positive-bignum*5?'' JonL  responded ``most-positive-bignum--my favorite number!'' Moon proposed time zones be multiples of 1/3600 so that they were even numbers of seconds.  (Some people suspected this was a subtle marketing ploy for Symbolics.) This amendment was accepted 11-0. Pitman proposed that we limit time zone to the range [-24,24], inclusive. The inclusive was to allow countries to disagree on which end was open, since it was agreed that the correct value here is a largely political, rather than technical issue.  The amendment was accepted 8-5. The full proposal with both amendments passed 18-0.*start*03393 00024 US GV-Info: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM at 10-Apr-89 09:21:43 from AGReturn-Path: <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Received: from STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM ([128.81.41.144]) by Xerox.COM ; 10 APR 89 09:21:42 PDTReceived: from BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM by STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM via CHAOS with CHAOS-MAIL id 574362; Mon 10-Apr-89 12:21:29 EDTDate: Mon, 10 Apr 89 12:20 EDTFrom: Kent M Pitman <KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Subject: Issue: TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER (Version 2)To: Masinter.PAcc: KMP@STONY-BROOK.SCRC.Symbolics.COMMessage-ID: <890410122049.7.KMP@BOBOLINK.SCRC.Symbolics.COM>Issue:        TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGERReferences:   Section 25.4.1 (Time Functions) (p. 443-444)Category:     CLARIFICATIONEdit history: 1-Mar-89, Version 1 by Chapman	      10-Apr-89, Version 2 by Pitman (amendments per X3J13)Status:       Passed v1 (as amended in v2) Mar-89 by 18-0 vote.Problem Description: CLtL states that the time zone part of Decoded Time is an integer. However, it is possible to have a non-integer time-zone.Proposal (TIME-ZONE-NON-INTEGER:ALLOW) Specify that the time zone part of Decoded Time is    1. a rational number (either an integer or a ratio)   2. in the range -24 to 24 (inclusive on both ends)   3. a multiple of 1/3600.Rationale: 1. For CL to accommodate all possible time designations, it is    necessary to allow time zone to be non-integer.  Some places    in the world are on half-hour or quarter-hour times.    There is no demand for floating point time zones.  Since such    zones would introduce inexact arithmetic, we did not consider    adding them at this time.     2. This prohibits the perverse use of very incredibly time zone    magnitudes to get around the year restriction on times    in portable code. 3. This requires time zones to be represented as even multiples    of 1 second.Current Practice: VAX LISP allows time zone to be non-integer.Cost to Implementors: Very slight. Implementations which use integer-only arithmetic in dealing with time zones might have to switch to a more generic kind of arithmetic.Cost to Users: Depends on situation. Very slight negative to very strong positive effects will be seen by users. In some cases, this legitimizes time zones which are already a political necessity and may make life easier for users. In at least one known case, this will make things a little harder because `very large' time zones will not be permitted.  However,  such time zones probably were not really portable to begin with so this is more just a recognition of the status quo.Benefits: See Rationale.Conversion Cost: In most cases, no user code will have to be modified. In the one known case using `very large' time zones, the user may have to write his own time manipulation software if he really wants to be portable.Aesthetics: Probably slightly improved.Discussion: Haflich was claiming he might want to use very large negative time zones to go back in history beyond 1900 (where universal times supposedly  bottom out).  However, most implementations probably don't represent the shifts in calendar system which occurred at various points before that time, most implementors present at the Mar-89 meeting seemed to think this `hack' was probably not really going to work portably anyway.
